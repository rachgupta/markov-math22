Again, I was mentioning this period of the course is sort of deliberately a moment to catch your breath,
to consolidate your knowledge over the first six weeks of the semester and to make sure that
you're feeling comfortable as we make sort of that push into the second half of the semester.
So problems at six will be a little bit shorter then.
So just to kind of as you're looking forward, problem sets seven, eight, nine and so forth will then get a little bit longer.
So just to keep that in mind, as your scheduling things going forward, don't too much get in the habit of starting things Tuesday night.
But I think this problem set is just to prove your problems are kind of fun problems.
I like them, but I don't want to give too many this week, especially when we don't have class on Monday.
So keep that in mind. Any questions about sort of logistics?
Yes. The plan is still office hours on Monday.
That's true, right? We have I mean, all the rooms are still booked.
I think this year we're all still planning on coming. So, yeah. Other questions, concerns.
Yes. I think so maybe Caleb could check for me.
They must be there because I know people have been asking me about them, so otherwise I don't know what they are.
But yeah. So they should be up there on the bottom.
Yeah. All right, so let's go ahead and dove into the math today, since we have a little bit of an abbreviated day with the quiz at the end.
So the goal and what we're doing is to connect back to this question of convertibility.
We would like to have other ways of thinking about inevitability.
OK, so when you're thinking about convertibility, our goal now is to develop a numerical test for convertibility.
So we would like to develop a numerical.
Test for convertibility. So let me be more precise about what I mean by that, so let's just think about what exactly I'm looking for here.
So I want to define the object that I'm studying will be the set of end by end matrices.
So I'm going to call to introduce some new notation for this ends up end by.
So this is the set. Oh, and by and matrices.
So we use this notation quite a lot, so we might as well introduce it now. So a notation, this is the set.
Where we have a one one, two, a one and down to a and one out to A and where these are all just real numbers.
OK, so that's what that said is it's a collection of and by and matrices, yes, we believe.
Sure, yeah, yeah, m sub m by.
Yep, that would be perfectly reasonable notation and could sometimes, of course be useful to.
And it sort of foreshadows what we're going to be doing next after determinants,
where we'll be thinking about making things a little bit more abstract. So really what I want here is the goal again is to define.
A function. So I'm going to call it dysfunction, debt for determinant such that it eats matrices,
so it's a function with domain, the space of and by and matrices, and then it's going to output a real number.
So at some function from this set to the real numbers where its output is telling me about the inevitability of its matrix.
So where I want the determinant of, say, a matrix, a to be non-zero if and only if.
A is convertible, so it's sort of an indicator of the inevitability of my matrix, so that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to build this function. We already know how to do this in some small cases, so in some small cases,
like when and is equal to one, we were able to define a quantity, the determinant.
So it was an indicator on one by one matrices for whether that matrix was inevitable or not.
So we defined the determinant of this one by one matrix with a single entry to just be that single entry.
Then we know that this matrix is convertible. If and only if.
This quantity, the determinant, that single entry is not equal to zero.
We did this as well.
We proved this in the case of two by two matrices, that now if we define the determinant to be this function on two by two matrices A,
B, C, D to be A, D minus B, C, then we had this nice result that this matrix A, B, C, D is convertible.
If and only if the determinant is non-zero.
But that's where our knowledge sort of stopped, we didn't have a nice result when we had larger matrices,
so we know quite a bit about if and only if we know quite a bit about this side of the story.
We have the inaudible matrix there and we have lots of conditions there and we'd like to use that to develop this other side of the story.
OK, so the goal today is to give a definition for what we mean by the determinant and then to uncover what do we know about this function?
What can it tell us? So I'm going to do this.
And what I think is kind of a long winded way, but I think I argue that it's a nice way to see it.
So hopefully you'll give me the benefit of the doubt in this approach.
But I kind of like it. So if I were approaching this problem for the very first time that I wanted to define a function that does this,
what I would do is I would take a three by three matrix and I would see what numerical condition
had to be satisfied on the entries and then try to define the determinant to be that.
So that's what I'm going to do.
So that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to try to actually do this when N is equal to three and a little bit of a cumbersome way.
So rather than just kind of telling you what the answer is, hopefully then you can see where the answer is coming from.
So I'm going to do this rather explicitly. So let's take an arbitrary three by three matrix.
A, B, C, D, e, uh. G h i.
So I want to now use the main theorem that I have on reversibility is that this
matrix will be convertible if and only if this row reduces to the identity matrix.
So if this matrix is going to be convertible, that I have a column of zeros here.
I have a column of zeros here. Yes. Uh.
Perfect, right? The Matrix Theorem already tells us that we need linearly independent columns,
so we immediately know from that theorem none of the columns could be all zeroes that would already tell us that it's not convertible.
So we're trying to find a different condition so we can assume that one of the entries in that first column is
non-zero because we can always just reorder the entries there because we're just writing down an arbitrary matrix.
I'm going to assume the topmost entry is non-zero, so we assume A is non-zero.
So then if I wanted to get rid of this entry D here and G here, one thing that I could do is I could multiply those rows by a.
So then I would have a, b, c, d, e, f some scaling by an elementary row operation, some scaling by A.
Then I have a G a h a.
All right, so then we could keep going, our next step would then be to try to get rid of this entry.
So I multiply the first row by negative D and add to the second row to get rid of that
entry and multiply the first row by negative G and add to this row to get that entry.
The result of doing that. Well then give me a zero zero.
Then the second column will be B and then I'll get a E minus BBD.
The next entry will be a H minus BG and then the third column will be C and then followed by A F minus C, D, A minus.
So, again, I would like to reduce this to the identity somehow,
so my goal is to kind of get rid of maybe this entry below that one so I can keep accumulating more zeros here.
Could it be the case that both of these two entries here, here, this entry and this entry, could they both be zero?
Could they both be zero? A few people are shaking their head.
Can anyone say why, yes, what? And I definitely won't release the identity and again, going back to the previous observation,
then this first column would not be linearly independent with the second column, right.
We would have then a dependent's relation among those of those two entries had to both be zero.
So we can, again, assume that one of these two entries is non-zero because we sort of arbitrarily labeled the entries.
We could swap them to assume that this one is a non-zero one. OK, so just like how is able to assume that A was non-zero?
I can similarly assume that a E minus Bhd would be non-zero.
So we do the same thing here that I'm going to multiply this entry by a E minus BBD and then I will do a row operation to get it to drop out.
So part of the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to avoid scaling t work with fractions here, but this would be a way around that.
So I can assume that one of them would be non-zero. Well, suppose that they were both zero, then what could you tell me about those first two columns?
We have to assume based is nonzero, the entry up here.
If this bee were also zero, then we would potentially be getting the zero vector if all three were zero.
So. Yeah, it's good to be concerned about these things, though, so it's a good question.
OK, so I'm going to do the same trick to try to get rid of this entry.
So if I do that, I will then have the Matrix A, B, C, I still have my Xeros here, then I have the second row is the same A C minus speed and A,
F minus C, D, and then I'm just changing this entry to get ready to get rid of it.
So I have a H minus B times A minus B and then I have A I minus CEG, times A minus B B.G.
So I'm just scaling that last row to, again, avoid working with fractions here, so now I can do this elementary operation to get rid of this entry.
So I'm going to multiply this row by negative H minus BG and then add to get rid of this entry.
So then I'll have A, B, C, I have zero A, B minus BG.
These two entries of course don't change A, F minus C, D.
And then I have zero zero and then this entry, I'm just going to label as a capital D for the moment.
What be the to become a middle? BD B'Day.
Ed. I'm impressed with your vision that you can actually read those many matrix as well.
B.G. Very good now, Jonathan.
I don't understand a lot. Capital D is the entry that would result from doing that cooperation operation, which I will write in one minute.
It's a lot and I'm going to write it in one minute anyway, so I just don't want to write it in my entry right there.
So to Jonathan's question, I want to write out what this is.
So if we write out exactly what the D is, D will be this complicated expression D is then equal to.
Well, I have the original thing that I had before, so I have a I minus C.G. times A, C minus B, D.
I don't know why I keep trying to write, jeez, they're bad.
So that was the original thing that I had. Now I have the term that I subtract it off.
So this is then this row scaled. So this would be then minus A, F minus C, D times A H minus Biji.
So it's just a bunch of terms.
We can multiply this out, you get the following, I'm not going to make you do it A squared E I minus A, B, C, D, minus A, E, C, G, plus, B, DCG minus.
Again, the idea is the most important part here. A squared F H plus a F big plus a HCB, then finally minus B DCG.
So not much is canceling. There is a term that will cancel here.
There's only one term that will cancel just this one.
So you might have hoped for more, but that's all we get. So which one?
A CD know this, yeah, so I have this term.
Right here I have H minus B.G., right?
So this term, not a hold on, everybody, stay with me, stay with me, if there's too much discussion, no one's going to hear my response.
OK, so right here, I want to get rid of this entry. What am I multiplying the second row by?
I'm multiplying by exactly this quantity H minus BG.
That's what I'm scaling this rowby in order to get rid of this entry.
So I'm multiplying this entry by negative H minus BG and adding to this entry.
So that's where I get it. Over here. Over here. Yeah, good question.
So again, I the point here is not the exact calculation.
The point is the idea behind the calculation. This is not a calculation we're going to repeat.
I'm just trying to get across where this is coming from. So if you are going to do this in general, this would be the expression we would end up with.
So here we get this. OK, so you're probably all getting annoyed with me, so it's getting kind of complicated.
So we would like to try to make sense of this complicated expression. So here there is one thing that we can say.
Well, I don't want to say that yet. There's one thing D every term that shows up here has an A in it.
So we could factor out in it to make this a little bit better, but that doesn't really make things that much better.
So if we did that, we would then resulting expression would be a e i minus I b d minus E c g minus A f h.
Plus B. F g. Plus H, c.
So this expression, what do you know about this expression, Capital D. if the matrix is going to be convertible?
The Matrix is supposed to be convertible, yes, oh, sorry, you're both right there.
The one who wants to go OK. Do you won't be equal to zero?
Right, so what should be equal to if we want this thing to be convertible?
I mean, where we eventually want this thing to be reduced to the identity matrix, right, but we especially want it to be non-zero.
So you're exactly right there. So we know. What do you know about the first factor?
It's non-zero, that was the starting point in all of this and a non-zero so determining then whether this matrix is then going to
be convertible or not is completely characterized by this complicated expression and why whether that's non-zero.
So that does fit the goal of what we're trying to do here. Right.
We could define the determinant of a three by three matrix to be this expression.
And that's exactly what we're going to do, is I'm going to define the determinant by this.
So this is what I'm going to then call the determinant of that three by three matrix.
So it does the job for us. Now, who wants to do a four by four? Nobody, Luke.
It's all incorporated in the single big term, because I started with my matrix ab a through I is being arbitrary.
So if there was no term that could be non-zero in that first column, I know that the whole thing is hopeless to work anyway.
Right. In particular, if you had like that first column A D and G being all zero, if a zero then this term will drop out.
If what else do we have. B is zero. So this term drops out. G is zero.
So this term drops out a zero. So this term drops out, B is zero.
So this term drops out desirous of this term, drops out to the whole thing would be zero anyway.
So it's all incorporated in there.
So we do have one complicated expression that incorporates everything which in principle you could do for any size matrix,
especially if you're comfortable with something like Mathematica. However, we are not computers.
We want to have more intuitive idea of what this is representing. So let's play around with this a little bit more.
So if this is going to be my definition of a determinant, I'd like to somehow for a three by three.
I haven't even talked about four by four yet. I'd like to somehow understand what this expression says.
So our goal is not to just, like, derive complicated expressions even though they would work, but we want to understand where they're coming from.
So what that suggests to me is that we try to understand this a little bit more.
And you say, well, that's hopeless, Dusty. Look at it. Well, there is something else we can do here.
So, for instance, I noticed this term and this term both have an AI.
So let's think about that for a second.
So the determinant of my overall matrix, a well, then I could factor out I have a times e i minus these two terms.
So f h. Plus a bunch of other stuff.
So let me put a minus sign there for a moment and we'll we'll there will be more.
But let's just analyze this first term for the moment. What does this remind you of?
David. It looks like the determinant of a two by two matrix, so let's maybe make a note of that.
So this first term looks like eight times the determinant of well, Etai needs to be on my main diagonal of this two by two.
So I and then I have FH on my A. diagonal here.
So I get this two by two matrix. That looks like it's related to my original matrix and that it's the bottom right of my original matrix,
so it gives me the sub matrix Jonathan notation.
But you know that. Around the because it's the determinant of this thing, you could if you wanted to be really precise, I mean,
put a determined expression around this entire thing with just one matrix going in,
I think we can all would interpret it OK, but that would be totally fine.
I mean, we would interpret it a reasonably if you want to, you could put parentheses there.
It just looks a little unpleasant to my eye.
So if it's possible to not write it, then I would not write it.
If confusion could arise, if you're multiplying by a bunch of other things, then I would right it, to be very precise.
So then we need to worry about these other terms. Well, if I look at this next term, I have A B and this one and I have a B in this one.
So I could then factor out a term for a reason that will become clear in a little bit.
I'm going to factor out a negative B, so then if I take out a negative B, then this term would become a positive one.
So then I have I d then minus F G and then again, that has the same expression of looking kind of like a determinant of a smaller matrix.
So let's put that in. So this would then be minus B times the determinant of D i.
F g. How does this one relate to my original matrix, this smaller sub matrix?
How does it look compared to my original thing? Right.
If I take out the middle row middle column, if I take out the middle column, then it's like the bottom two entries.
So if I take out that first row and the middle column, it seems like that's what's left.
And the first one seems like if I took out the first row and the first column, that's what's left.
Let's think about what happened to my last bit now. Plus C plus C.
So here, if I look at what terms I have here, I have an HD minus EEG, which again has this expression that looks like a two by two determinate.
So we could express that as the determinant of the matrix.
D. H, then E. G and if you look back to your original matrix up there, that one exactly corresponds to deleting the first row and the third column.
This thing seems like something that I could kind of interpret. It doesn't seem like an expression that I need to memorize.
It seems like an expression that I could just understand where it's coming from, from the pattern that seems to be appearing here,
where it's the entry then times the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting that row and column and then with an alternating
sine minus B times the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row in the second column and so forth.
So this suggests a way that I could iteratively construct determinants from smaller determinants to get at the determinant of an end by N Matrix.
So now, rather than trying to take a general four by four matrix and do all of this song and dance again, you will get the same answer.
But I could now guess a more general formula and then I will prove that that formula does what we want.
Tommy. The.
What did you do with the. No.
So if you're a equals zero, I mean, they can equals zero and your matrix could still be convertible.
So I mean, it's just that not all of your entries there about ADD and can't all be zero.
It's the first column. Can't all be zero. We can find a non-zero entry for that topmost entry.
That's Mike. So suppose that you had a matrix where your first column was all zeros,
then we've already observed that Matrix won't be convertible and this formula gives me the determinant to zero.
So they both agree. So we know some entry in that first column has to be non-zero.
We also know that the question of inevitability follows from getting to row
equivalent matrices so we can move that non-zero entry to the top position.
So this is not a problem where we're getting exactly what the inverse is, which will depend on exactly what the one one entry is.
But this is an algorithm that just tells us whether the Matrix is convertible or not.
And that's perfectly fine that the one one entry entry could be zero and your matrix might still be convertible.
Yes. Why is this big thing the determinative?
Because that's what I'm defining it the determinant way to be. It's a definition.
So go back to the goal, right? This is an unknown expression, there is no function yet called the determinant, right?
This has never been introduced before in our class. So I get to define it, to be whatever I want.
So what I want it to do is I want it to characterize convertibility.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to define the determinant of a three by three matrix in order to encode invert ability.
So then I need to know how could I do that? I know for a two by two matrix, I just define it to be a D minus BC.
So what I'm doing here with this calculation is I'm deriving a numerical condition on the entries that would tell me whether or not it's convertible.
So then once I've done that, I define the determinant to be that expression.
The upshot of doing this is that it agrees with now this inductive description that I've described here,
which then we can use to define the deployment of a four by four and a five by five and a six by six and so forth.
Follow up question. What?
Uh huh. I'm sorry, I can't quite hear you.
Can you say it a little bit louder? But.
Yes, so we've defined the determinant of a two by two already. So then I can use that to define a three by three.
It's an iterative definition. So from the smaller determinants, I define bigger determinants.
And I'm just observing with this next line that it agrees with what I've already defined
for two by two determinants like this is the expression of a two by two determinate.
This is now the determinant of a three by three matrix. Then the question becomes, what's the determinant of a four by four matrix?
What's the determinant of a five by five matrix? What's the determinant of a six by six matrix?
You could do exactly the same thing again. It becomes increasingly unpleasant to do that.
But instead we could use the determinant of a three by three matrix to then define the determinant of a four by four.
Does that answer your question? OK, ask me again after class, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about, I mean,
here I'm trying to motivate why we would define the definition to be what it is.
So now we're in a position where I'm actually going to give you the definition. So this is an explicit expression.
Some of you might have even seen this before,
like mnemonics in a high school algebra class for how you tell what the determinant is for a three by three.
Like sometimes you would just memorize this formula, but I don't want you to memorize the formula.
Arjun. Like a lot.
In the first place, we have this. And then a follow up question is.
Wouldn't. So the first question I'll answer the second question first will prove later that if I switch the rows of a matrix,
then the determinants will be equal. That's not something that's inherently clear from what we've done by any means.
For the second question, since I've labeled these entries arbitrarily,
I can choose the first entry A the one one entry, the entry to be non zero because I'm doing row reduction.
Right. So when you're doing rate reduction, you're doing elementary rule operations.
So your next step could be to interchange the rows in order to get that top entry to be zero.
So then I'm just trying to derive some condition on the entries. That then would be a plausible definition for the determinant.
I have not yet proven that this and this expression does everything we hope it would do.
I'm only trying to motivate why such an expression would exist and how we could get at it.
It's still work we need to do to prove that this expression or this expression actually does all the things that we want.
I'm simply trying to get at a way of defining what the determinant would be for larger matrices in terms of smaller matrices.
Other questions. Yes. My initial a what?
This one, because I don't need to, is the reason why, because A was already assumed to be non zero and this expression.
So if I were just if this was already assumed to be a non-zero entry, because I know not all the entries will be zero,
well, then why not just if it's not giving me any more information, then take the other piece.
I want to take the minimal amount that I need to. Yes. A.
Mm hmm. So if this thing were non-zero right then I know this entry, the capital D would be a non-zero entry.
So then my matrix has three pivots. So the Matrix Theorem then says the original matrix is convertible.
About. There are baby.
It should not be zero, if it were zero, what would we do?
If it were zero, what would we do? We change the rules, right?
These can't both be zero because then we would have to linearly dependent columns right here.
So that's why we know they both can't be zero,
and I was allowed to make that assumption that at least one of them would be nonzero, the same thing with the A's.
I can't have a column of zeros because then the Matrix can't be convertible. Because we know that, again,
the key underlying argument here that we're looking at is that this matrix is inevitable if and only if it's equivalent to the identity matrix.
So I'm just taking arbitrary matrix and I'm asking what conditions would have to
be true on the entries in order for it to be equivalent to the identity matrix.
If the call, the first column was all zeros. Well, then I know I'm already done because it can't be relevant to the identity matrix.
So then this whole problem, I don't need to proceed at all. So then I say, well, I assume one of those entries is non-zero.
If the top leftmost entry is non-zero, we can then we're going to do row operations anyway.
So then just do a row operation to make that one non-zero. The same thing is true when we get to this stage.
Both of these entries can't be zero because if they were zero, you would immediately know that you can't be equivalent to an identity matrix.
So then we assume one of them is non-zero if it's this one and not this one.
Well, then we interchange rows to make this one the one that's non-zero.
Because these labels at the beginning of which entries I called a through, I were arbitrary,
when you do those row interchanges, you could be switching those entries. So the overall expression that we're getting will still work.
Other questions, yes, Inoko. No.
Which entry, Gabrielle Xeros. D So that's interesting, but these entries could be non-zero so that my overall expression becomes non-zero.
Yeah, so it's not quite true, I could have like DNG both being zero and still have the overall thing be convertible.
It would depend on the other entries like. Yes.
Yeah, so if you if you did the same thing for two by two,
we could make this thing roll call once the identity matrix and then that would suggest the entry that we want to look for,
to characterize inheritability would be a A.B.C. That's one way of getting at that notion of A.B.C. being important.
So, again, the exact calculation here is not the thing to get hung up on.
The point is that we're trying to do a calculation to inform what the definition would need to be.
OK, so I have not yet given you a definition of the determinant. I'm trying to define what it should be in order to do what we want.
So for a three by three, we could use this formula. In fact, this is the formula that's often given in a previous algebra class.
And you just say this is what it is. There's no motivation given at all. So I'm just trying to see where that formula might be coming from.
So now we can use an iterative formula to define the determinant for any size matrix.
So I want to give a little bit of notation here. When you delete a particular row and column, this is called The Minor of a Matrix.
So when I delete the first row and first column, this is called the one one minor of your matrix.
When I delete the first row and second column, this is called the one to Minor.
And when you delete the first row and the third column, this is the one three minor of a matrix.
So in this expression, we could rewrite the determinant of my three by three matrix to be equal to a times the determinant of what I'll
call a one one minus B times the determinant of a one two plus C times the determinant of a one three where.
Ay ay, Jay is the eye, Jay.
Minor. Of a. Which is obtained by.
The leading. The I throw.
And I throw and jth column.
So that suggests a way of defining this overall function that I want.
Again, it's very much an open question to prove that this new function, this new definition does what you want,
but at least it's verified computationally for one by one, two by two and three by three matrices.
It does what we want. So now definition.
For and greater than or equal to to the determinant.
Of an by and Matrixx A. Which is entries are just called AJ is given by the following formula.
So we've defined a two by two matrix, so a three by three will be fine in terms of two by twos,
a four by four we define in terms of three by threes and so forth.
So the determinant of your overall matrix A will be iteratively constructed from smaller size determinants.
So this will be a one one times the determinant of the minor obtained from deleting the first row and column from your matrix.
Then I'm going to do an alternating sum, just like I did there.
So minus a one two times the determinant of the matrix obtained from deleting the first row and second column.
So note these determinants are then of one size smaller. So I'm just doing an iterative construction.
So I'm saying what the determinant of an end by N Matrix in terms of and minus one by N minus one.
So plus. Oops, I forgot my sign.
One plus an. One and.
So we just continue that formula, alternating sign all the way down, so if you want, you can certainly write this in Sigma notation.
A one J times the determinant and the minus sign again, minus one to the one plus J times the determinant of a one J.
So this is now how I'm defining the determinant. So if you're asked to define the determinant, this is what I mean.
Jonathan, we're not moving this, this, that is.
We outlined earlier.
You should verify computationally that if I do it for a three by three, that it's exactly this formula, but that's an offer to buy two for the others.
I haven't defined anything. And so this is the definition. So we're close to it.
Yes, we're defining it like these. Yes, so the peranich was two and three, we have an explicit formula in terms of the coefficients.
It's not a formula that I would ever commit to memory unless you feel like it. I mean, for a two by two, you need to know it.
But for this formula, you could have I mean, some people have mnemonics for remembering this and so forth.
But have you ever wanted a computer? You could just compute it using the definition, using this expression.
What I'm saying.
Yes, convertibility, yes, that's still open, that's a theory and we need to prove so I'm now giving a definition like one of our major objectives.
We're proving that this definition does what we want.
The reason why I suspect that it does is because I derived this formula from explicitly working out.
And the unequals two case in the end equals three case. So that was my attempt to get motivation for where this formula would come from.
Arjan. Other questions, yep.
Computing a determinant? So that's a good question.
So that's one reason why you might want multiple definitions of something.
So like certainly like coming up with a more efficient way of computing, a determinant,
it is an attractive thing to want to think about how you could get at that.
This is a computation, though, that we could definitely just do one thing.
You'll note like this was mildly unpleasant for us to do, but RO operations are very quick for a computer to do so.
One thing that you could do is you could use RO operations to compute your determinants and that's a computationally efficient way to do it.
But we just need to prove that that still does what we want, that it agrees with this definition.
So it kind of goes back to the philosophy of this course. This definition is useful from some perspectives.
It's not useful from other perspectives, just like when we were talking about linear algebra in general.
We want in many ways of thinking about the same object because maybe computationally one method is not very efficient,
but conceptually it does give us some efficiency. So here we'll do the same thing where this method, this definition will give us some mileage,
but then we'll get other ways of thinking about the determinant as well. Does that answer your question, other questions?
Yes. If yes, how to find the cool factor.
So a bit more terminology, I suppose we can also talk about the cool factor expansion.
So here's my determinant, perhaps before I define the cool factor, as Tommy wants me to it,
it does appear in your notes maybe it would help with some of the questions that
seem to be circulating around the room to do an example of actually doing this.
So let's compute it. So let's go back to my favorite matrix.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, please don't be shy in asking questions.
If there are questions, it's better to just ask them.
Well, rather than just having your own conversations, because that makes it hard for everyone to hear.
Yes. We only go across the first row, yeah, we're only going across the first row,
the other entries in your matrix will certainly show up in these smaller determinants,
though, because like this stone won't have any of the entries in the first row.
And I'll just add all the entries further below that in The Matrix. Yes.
How could a computer computer determine it by rote reduction, I'll prove some properties of doing how doing raw operations changes your determinant,
and then from that we will know how the determinant will change.
And then we can just read it off from the end of the day from doing those RO operations. So we haven't gotten there yet.
That's a good question. We'll get back to that, Tommy.
Yes, Debbie. That's a property I haven't proven yet. But yeah, I mean, you could iterate through the columns as well.
So your good questions are sort of jumping ahead of exactly where we are.
I think some people are still talking about the definition. Are there other questions?
People just talking about the quiz, what's going on with studying something else?
No one wants to listen to me. It's OK for Dusty.
At least you're all awake, that doesn't always happen.
It's funny, I'll tell you what, my only math joke, so.
So my actual title in many academics are title is a lecturer,
and so the funny thing about the job title of a lecturer is that some people talk in their sleep, but lecturers talk and other people sleep so well.
Hopefully that doesn't happen too often here. I understand sometimes you're coming off of an all nighter, but.
All right. So here, if I want to compute the determinant of this, I literally want to use this definition.
So what does that say to do? It says take the one one entry so one finds the determinant of the one one minor.
So that means you delete the first row and first column. So you get five, six, eight, nine, then minus the one two entry.
So two times the determinant of four, six, seven, nine, and then plus the one three entry,
three times the determinant of now the two by two matrix four or five seven eight.
So that's literally me just following the symbols around to compute this thing, first of all, like knowing what you know about this matrix,
what do you expect the determinant should come out to be if it's doing what we hope it does?
Why? Someone said, zero, why? They're linear.
Are they linearly independent or are they not linearly independent, they're what?
They're linearly dependent. So the environment matrix, they're able to tell me this matrix is not inevitable.
So if this if this expression that I've defined has any merit at all, this had better come out to be zero.
So let's make sure it does. I hear some skepticism.
I feel like the class doesn't believe me whether it will come out to be zero or not.
Yes. Well, that's a good question.
So who answered the question who I mean, why would you know that these columns would be linearly dependent?
How could you check if you didn't see that? Tommy. Accused of personal.
Uh huh. Mm hmm.
So there'll be a zero, so if you started doing the reduction here, you would get a row of zeros, so then you know that there's a free variable.
So the Matrix Equation X equals zero has infinitely many solutions.
So then, you know, the vector equation involving the three columns then has a non-trivial dependent's relation.
Good question. OK, so let's actually do this computation.
So what do we have one times then. Here I have forty five minus.
What do we have here. Forty eight.
Then my next entry will be minus two times thirty six, minus forty two, plus three times thirty two, minus thirty five.
So this looks like it's giving me negative nine. This looks like it's giving me negative three, so that's negative 12 already.
So then right here I get then negative six times, negative two.
So positive 12. So, hey, good. It does work out. So there's at least some evidence that this is doing what we want.
So again, this is not a proof by any means that this crazy definition of a determinant actually encodes the property that we want.
We only have some evidence and for some small matrices, I think Caleb's going to yell at me in a minute.
So. In my last little bit of time, I guess maybe I'll just try to clean up some low hanging fruit here in terms of some terminology.
So as Tommy pointed out in this expression, we have cofactors.
So that's this included with the sign. That's what we call the IJA ko factor.
So let me just make sure that terminology appears in your notes. So we have miners and cofactors, so the I j.
Cool factor, cool factor. Of The Matrix is just that expression, which I'll refer to as C, J,
minus one to the I plus J times the determinant of the minor obtained from deleting the I throw and jth column.
So in this case, we're doing then this cool factor, expansion of the first row,
so the determinant that in terms of cofactors is equal to this expression,
a one one one one plus a one to see one, two plus da da plus a one and see one.
And so it's incorporating the sign along with those smaller determinants.
But it's not taking the entries, Arjun. Because I can do this for any road, not just the first row, just like reminders,
I don't necessarily have to delete the first row in a matrix to give the minor,
but I can delete any row and get the minor according to deleting that row.
And which leads me to maybe the next theorem is that if you do this expansion along any row or column, you'll get the same thing.
So that's cool. Factor expansion along any row or column will give you the same thing. So that's where I guess I should pick up with things next time.
So again, for your piece that that's due on Wednesday, all you need is the definition of determinates.
So you need this expression and that should be all that you need to work with it.
Yes. Hold on.
I can't hear the question. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Because that one is only across, Jay is one, it's across the first row in the cool factor, I can do any row.
Yeah. All right, please put away your notes.
Let's take this quiz. All right, please put away your cell phones, your notes, please don't turn away, turn over the quiz until it's time.
t six weeks of the semester and to make sure that
you're feeling comfortable as we make sort of that push into the second half of the semester.
So problems at six will be a little bit shorter then.
So just to kind of as you're looking forward, problem sets seven, eight, nine and so forth will then get a little bit longer.
So just to keep that in mind, as your scheduling things going forward, don't too much get in the habit of starting things Tuesday night.
But I think this problem set is just to prove your problems are kind of fun problems.
I like them, but I don't want to give too many this week, especially when we don't have class on Monday.
So keep that in mind. Any questions about sort of logistics?
Yes. The plan is still office hours on Monday.
That's true, right? We have I mean, all the rooms are still booked.
I think this year we're all still planning on coming. So, yeah. Other questions, concerns.
Yes. I think so maybe Caleb could check for me.
They must be there because I know people have been asking me about them, so otherwise I don't know what they are.
But yeah. So they should be up there on the bottom.
Yeah. All right, so let's go ahead and dove into the math today, since we have a little bit of an abbreviated day with the quiz at the end.
So the goal and what we're doing is to connect back to this question of convertibility.
We would like to have other ways of thinking about inevitability.
OK, so when you're thinking about convertibility, our goal now is to develop a numerical test for convertibility.
So we would like to develop a numerical.
Test for convertibility. So let me be more precise about what I mean by that, so let's just think about what exactly I'm looking for here.
So I want to define the object that I'm studying will be the set of end by end matrices.
So I'm going to call to introduce some new notation for this ends up end by.
So this is the set. Oh, and by and matrices.
So we use this notation quite a lot, so we might as well introduce it now. So a notation, this is the set.
Where we have a one one, two, a one and down to a and one out to A and where these are all just real numbers.
OK, so that's what that said is it's a collection of and by and matrices, yes, we believe.
Sure, yeah, yeah, m sub m by.
Yep, that would be perfectly reasonable notation and could sometimes, of course be useful to.
And it sort of foreshadows what we're going to be doing next after determinants,
where we'll be thinking about making things a little bit more abstract. So really what I want here is the goal again is to define.
A function. So I'm going to call it dysfunction, debt for determinant such that it eats matrices,
so it's a function with domain, the space of and by and matrices, and then it's going to output a real number.
So at some function from this set to the real numbers where its output is telling me about the inevitability of its matrix.
So where I want the determinant of, say, a matrix, a to be non-zero if and only if.
A is convertible, so it's sort of an indicator of the inevitability of my matrix, so that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to build this function. We already know how to do this in some small cases, so in some small cases,
like when and is equal to one, we were able to define a quantity, the determinant.
So it was an indicator on one by one matrices for whether that matrix was inevitable or not.
So we defined the determinant of this one by one matrix with a single entry to just be that single entry.
Then we know that this matrix is convertible. If and only if.
This quantity, the determinant, that single entry is not equal to zero.
We did this as well.
We proved this in the case of two by two matrices, that now if we define the determinant to be this function on two by two matrices A,
B, C, D to be A, D minus B, C, then we had this nice result that this matrix A, B, C, D is convertible.
If and only if the determinant is non-zero.
But that's where our knowledge sort of stopped, we didn't have a nice result when we had larger matrices,
so we know quite a bit about if and only if we know quite a bit about this side of the story.
We have the inaudible matrix there and we have lots of conditions there and we'd like to use that to develop this other side of the story.
OK, so the goal today is to give a definition for what we mean by the determinant and then to uncover what do we know about this function?
What can it tell us? So I'm going to do this.
And what I think is kind of a long winded way, but I think I argue that it's a nice way to see it.
So hopefully you'll give me the benefit of the doubt in this approach.
But I kind of like it. So if I were approaching this problem for the very first time that I wanted to define a function that does this,
what I would do is I would take a three by three matrix and I would see what numerical condition
had to be satisfied on the entries and then try to define the determinant to be that.
So that's what I'm going to do.
So that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to try to actually do this when N is equal to three and a little bit of a cumbersome way.
So rather than just kind of telling you what the answer is, hopefully then you can see where the answer is coming from.
So I'm going to do this rather explicitly. So let's take an arbitrary three by three matrix.
A, B, C, D, e, uh. G h i.
So I want to now use the main theorem that I have on reversibility is that this
matrix will be convertible if and only if this row reduces to the identity matrix.
So if this matrix is going to be convertible, that I have a column of zeros here.
I have a column of zeros here. Yes. Uh.
Perfect, right? The Matrix Theorem already tells us that we need linearly independent columns,
so we immediately know from that theorem none of the columns could be all zeroes that would already tell us that it's not convertible.
So we're trying to find a different condition so we can assume that one of the entries in that first column is
non-zero because we can always just reorder the entries there because we're just writing down an arbitrary matrix.
I'm going to assume the topmost entry is non-zero, so we assume A is non-zero.
So then if I wanted to get rid of this entry D here and G here, one thing that I could do is I could multiply those rows by a.
So then I would have a, b, c, d, e, f some scaling by an elementary row operation, some scaling by A.
Then I have a G a h a.
All right, so then we could keep going, our next step would then be to try to get rid of this entry.
So I multiply the first row by negative D and add to the second row to get rid of that
entry and multiply the first row by negative G and add to this row to get that entry.
The result of doing that. Well then give me a zero zero.
Then the second column will be B and then I'll get a E minus BBD.
The next entry will be a H minus BG and then the third column will be C and then followed by A F minus C, D, A minus.
So, again, I would like to reduce this to the identity somehow,
so my goal is to kind of get rid of maybe this entry below that one so I can keep accumulating more zeros here.
Could it be the case that both of these two entries here, here, this entry and this entry, could they both be zero?
Could they both be zero? A few people are shaking their head.
Can anyone say why, yes, what? And I definitely won't release the identity and again, going back to the previous observation,
then this first column would not be linearly independent with the second column, right.
We would have then a dependent's relation among those of those two entries had to both be zero.
So we can, again, assume that one of these two entries is non-zero because we sort of arbitrarily labeled the entries.
We could swap them to assume that this one is a non-zero one. OK, so just like how is able to assume that A was non-zero?
I can similarly assume that a E minus Bhd would be non-zero.
So we do the same thing here that I'm going to multiply this entry by a E minus BBD and then I will do a row operation to get it to drop out.
So part of the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to avoid scaling t work with fractions here, but this would be a way around that.
So I can assume that one of them would be non-zero. Well, suppose that they were both zero, then what could you tell me about those first two columns?
We have to assume based is nonzero, the entry up here.
If this bee were also zero, then we would potentially be getting the zero vector if all three were zero.
So. Yeah, it's good to be concerned about these things, though, so it's a good question.
OK, so I'm going to do the same trick to try to get rid of this entry.
So if I do that, I will then have the Matrix A, B, C, I still have my Xeros here, then I have the second row is the same A C minus speed and A,
F minus C, D, and then I'm just changing this entry to get ready to get rid of it.
So I have a H minus B times A minus B and then I have A I minus CEG, times A minus B B.G.
So I'm just scaling that last row to, again, avoid working with fractions here, so now I can do this elementary operation to get rid of this entry.
So I'm going to multiply this row by negative H minus BG and then add to get rid of this entry.
So then I'll have A, B, C, I have zero A, B minus BG.
These two entries of course don't change A, F minus C, D.
And then I have zero zero and then this entry, I'm just going to label as a capital D for the moment.
What be the to become a middle? BD B'Day.
Ed. I'm impressed with your vision that you can actually read those many matrix as well.
B.G. Very good now, Jonathan.
I don't understand a lot. Capital D is the entry that would result from doing that cooperation operation, which I will write in one minute.
It's a lot and I'm going to write it in one minute anyway, so I just don't want to write it in my entry right there.
So to Jonathan's question, I want to write out what this is.
So if we write out exactly what the D is, D will be this complicated expression D is then equal to.
Well, I have the original thing that I had before, so I have a I minus C.G. times A, C minus B, D.
I don't know why I keep trying to write, jeez, they're bad.
So that was the original thing that I had. Now I have the term that I subtract it off.
So this is then this row scaled. So this would be then minus A, F minus C, D times A H minus Biji.
So it's just a bunch of terms.
We can multiply this out, you get the following, I'm not going to make you do it A squared E I minus A, B, C, D, minus A, E, C, G, plus, B, DCG minus.
Again, the idea is the most important part here. A squared F H plus a F big plus a HCB, then finally minus B DCG.
So not much is canceling. There is a term that will cancel here.
There's only one term that will cancel just this one.
So you might have hoped for more, but that's all we get. So which one?
A CD know this, yeah, so I have this term.
Right here I have H minus B.G., right?
So this term, not a hold on, everybody, stay with me, stay with me, if there's too much discussion, no one's going to hear my response.
OK, so right here, I want to get rid of this entry. What am I multiplying the second row by?
I'm multiplying by exactly this quantity H minus BG.
That's what I'm scaling this rowby in order to get rid of this entry.
So I'm multiplying this entry by negative H minus BG and adding to this entry.
So that's where I get it. Over here. Over here. Yeah, good question.
So again, I the point here is not the exact calculation.
The point is the idea behind the calculation. This is not a calculation we're going to repeat.
I'm just trying to get across where this is coming from. So if you are going to do this in general, this would be the expression we would end up with.
So here we get this. OK, so you're probably all getting annoyed with me, so it's getting kind of complicated.
So we would like to try to make sense of this complicated expression. So here there is one thing that we can say.
Well, I don't want to say that yet. There's one thing D every term that shows up here has an A in it.
So we could factor out in it to make this a little bit better, but that doesn't really make things that much better.
So if we did that, we would then resulting expression would be a e i minus I b d minus E c g minus A f h.
Plus B. F g. Plus H, c.
So this expression, what do you know about this expression, Capital D. if the matrix is going to be convertible?
The Matrix is supposed to be convertible, yes, oh, sorry, you're both right there.
The one who wants to go OK. Do you won't be equal to zero?
Right, so what should be equal to if we want this thing to be convertible?
I mean, where we eventually want this thing to be reduced to the identity matrix, right, but we especially want it to be non-zero.
So you're exactly right there. So we know. What do you know about the first factor?
It's non-zero, that was the starting point in all of this and a non-zero so determining then whether this matrix is then going to
be convertible or not is completely characterized by this complicated expression and why whether that's non-zero.
So that does fit the goal of what we're trying to do here. Right.
We could define the determinant of a three by three matrix to be this expression.
And that's exactly what we're going to do, is I'm going to define the determinant by this.
So this is what I'm going to then call the determinant of that three by three matrix.
So it does the job for us. Now, who wants to do a four by four? Nobody, Luke.
It's all incorporated in the single big term, because I started with my matrix ab a through I is being arbitrary.
So if there was no term that could be non-zero in that first column, I know that the whole thing is hopeless to work anyway.
Right. In particular, if you had like that first column A D and G being all zero, if a zero then this term will drop out.
If what else do we have. B is zero. So this term drops out. G is zero.
So this term drops out a zero. So this term drops out, B is zero.
So this term drops out desirous of this term, drops out to the whole thing would be zero anyway.
So it's all incorporated in there.
So we do have one complicated expression that incorporates everything which in principle you could do for any size matrix,
especially if you're comfortable with something like Mathematica. However, we are not computers.
We want to have more intuitive idea of what this is representing. So let's play around with this a little bit more.
So if this is going to be my definition of a determinant, I'd like to somehow for a three by three.
I haven't even talked about four by four yet. I'd like to somehow understand what this expression says.
So our goal is not to just, like, derive complicated expressions even though they would work, but we want to understand where they're coming from.
So what that suggests to me is that we try to understand this a little bit more.
And you say, well, that's hopeless, Dusty. Look at it. Well, there is something else we can do here.
So, for instance, I noticed this term and this term both have an AI.
So let's think about that for a second.
So the determinant of my overall matrix, a well, then I could factor out I have a times e i minus these two terms.
So f h. Plus a bunch of other stuff.
So let me put a minus sign there for a moment and we'll we'll there will be more.
But let's just analyze this first term for the moment. What does this remind you of?
David. It looks like the determinant of a two by two matrix, so let's maybe make a note of that.
So this first term looks like eight times the determinant of well, Etai needs to be on my main diagonal of this two by two.
So I and then I have FH on my A. diagonal here.
So I get this two by two matrix. That looks like it's related to my original matrix and that it's the bottom right of my original matrix,
so it gives me the sub matrix Jonathan notation.
But you know that. Around the because it's the determinant of this thing, you could if you wanted to be really precise, I mean,
put a determined expression around this entire thing with just one matrix going in,
I think we can all would interpret it OK, but that would be totally fine.
I mean, we would interpret it a reasonably if you want to, you could put parentheses there.
It just looks a little unpleasant to my eye.
So if it's possible to not write it, then I would not write it.
If confusion could arise, if you're multiplying by a bunch of other things, then I would right it, to be very precise.
So then we need to worry about these other terms. Well, if I look at this next term, I have A B and this one and I have a B in this one.
So I could then factor out a term for a reason that will become clear in a little bit.
I'm going to factor out a negative B, so then if I take out a negative B, then this term would become a positive one.
So then I have I d then minus F G and then again, that has the same expression of looking kind of like a determinant of a smaller matrix.
So let's put that in. So this would then be minus B times the determinant of D i.
F g. How does this one relate to my original matrix, this smaller sub matrix?
How does it look compared to my original thing? Right.
If I take out the middle row middle column, if I take out the middle column, then it's like the bottom two entries.
So if I take out that first row and the middle column, it seems like that's what's left.
And the first one seems like if I took out the first row and the first column, that's what's left.
Let's think about what happened to my last bit now. Plus C plus C.
So here, if I look at what terms I have here, I have an HD minus EEG, which again has this expression that looks like a two by two determinate.
So we could express that as the determinant of the matrix.
D. H, then E. G and if you look back to your original matrix up there, that one exactly corresponds to deleting the first row and the third column.
This thing seems like something that I could kind of interpret. It doesn't seem like an expression that I need to memorize.
It seems like an expression that I could just understand where it's coming from, from the pattern that seems to be appearing here,
where it's the entry then times the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting that row and column and then with an alternating
sine minus B times the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row in the second column and so forth.
So this suggests a way that I could iteratively construct determinants from smaller determinants to get at the determinant of an end by N Matrix.
So now, rather than trying to take a general four by four matrix and do all of this song and dance again, you will get the same answer.
But I could now guess a more general formula and then I will prove that that formula does what we want.
Tommy. The.
What did you do with the. No.
So if you're a equals zero, I mean, they can equals zero and your matrix could still be convertible.
So I mean, it's just that not all of your entries there about ADD and can't all be zero.
It's the first column. Can't all be zero. We can find a non-zero entry for that topmost entry.
That's Mike. So suppose that you had a matrix where your first column was all zeros,
then we've already observed that Matrix won't be convertible and this formula gives me the determinant to zero.
So they both agree. So we know some entry in that first column has to be non-zero.
We also know that the question of inevitability follows from getting to row
equivalent matrices so we can move that non-zero entry to the top position.
So this is not a problem where we're getting exactly what the inverse is, which will depend on exactly what the one one entry is.
But this is an algorithm that just tells us whether the Matrix is convertible or not.
And that's perfectly fine that the one one entry entry could be zero and your matrix might still be convertible.
Yes. Why is this big thing the determinative?
Because that's what I'm defining it the determinant way to be. It's a definition.
So go back to the goal, right? This is an unknown expression, there is no function yet called the determinant, right?
This has never been introduced before in our class. So I get to define it, to be whatever I want.
So what I want it to do is I want it to characterize convertibility.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to define the determinant of a three by three matrix in order to encode invert ability.
So then I need to know how could I do that? I know for a two by two matrix, I just define it to be a D minus BC.
So what I'm doing here with this calculation is I'm deriving a numerical condition on the entries that would tell me whether or not it's convertible.
So then once I've done that, I define the determinant to be that expression.
The upshot of doing this is that it agrees with now this inductive description that I've described here,
which then we can use to define the deployment of a four by four and a five by five and a six by six and so forth.
Follow up question. What?
Uh huh. I'm sorry, I can't quite hear you.
Can you say it a little bit louder? But.
Yes, so we've defined the determinant of a two by two already. So then I can use that to define a three by three.
It's an iterative definition. So from the smaller determinants, I define bigger determinants.
And I'm just observing with this next line that it agrees with what I've already defined
for two by two determinants like this is the expression of a two by two determinate.
This is now the determinant of a three by three matrix. Then the question becomes, what's the determinant of a four by four matrix?
What's the determinant of a five by five matrix? What's the determinant of a six by six matrix?
You could do exactly the same thing again. It becomes increasingly unpleasant to do that.
But instead we could use the determinant of a three by three matrix to then define the determinant of a four by four.
Does that answer your question? OK, ask me again after class, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about, I mean,
here I'm trying to motivate why we would define the definition to be what it is.
So now we're in a position where I'm actually going to give you the definition. So this is an explicit expression.
Some of you might have even seen this before,
like mnemonics in a high school algebra class for how you tell what the determinant is for a three by three.
Like sometimes you would just memorize this formula, but I don't want you to memorize the formula.
Arjun. Like a lot.
In the first place, we have this. And then a follow up question is.
Wouldn't. So the first question I'll answer the second question first will prove later that if I switch the rows of a matrix,
then the determinants will be equal. That's not something that's inherently clear from what we've done by any means.
For the second question, since I've labeled these entries arbitrarily,
I can choose the first entry A the one one entry, the entry to be non zero because I'm doing row reduction.
Right. So when you're doing rate reduction, you're doing elementary rule operations.
So your next step could be to interchange the rows in order to get that top entry to be zero.
So then I'm just trying to derive some condition on the entries. That then would be a plausible definition for the determinant.
I have not yet proven that this and this expression does everything we hope it would do.
I'm only trying to motivate why such an expression would exist and how we could get at it.
It's still work we need to do to prove that this expression or this expression actually does all the things that we want.
I'm simply trying to get at a way of defining what the determinant would be for larger matrices in terms of smaller matrices.
Other questions. Yes. My initial a what?
This one, because I don't need to, is the reason why, because A was already assumed to be non zero and this expression.
So if I were just if this was already assumed to be a non-zero entry, because I know not all the entries will be zero,
well, then why not just if it's not giving me any more information, then take the other piece.
I want to take the minimal amount that I need to. Yes. A.
Mm hmm. So if this thing were non-zero right then I know this entry, the capital D would be a non-zero entry.
So then my matrix has three pivots. So the Matrix Theorem then says the original matrix is convertible.
About. There are baby.
It should not be zero, if it were zero, what would we do?
If it were zero, what would we do? We change the rules, right?
These can't both be zero because then we would have to linearly dependent columns right here.
So that's why we know they both can't be zero,
and I was allowed to make that assumption that at least one of them would be nonzero, the same thing with the A's.
I can't have a column of zeros because then the Matrix can't be convertible. Because we know that, again,
the key underlying argument here that we're looking at is that this matrix is inevitable if and only if it's equivalent to the identity matrix.
So I'm just taking arbitrary matrix and I'm asking what conditions would have to
be true on the entries in order for it to be equivalent to the identity matrix.
If the call, the first column was all zeros. Well, then I know I'm already done because it can't be relevant to the identity matrix.
So then this whole problem, I don't need to proceed at all. So then I say, well, I assume one of those entries is non-zero.
If the top leftmost entry is non-zero, we can then we're going to do row operations anyway.
So then just do a row operation to make that one non-zero. The same thing is true when we get to this stage.
Both of these entries can't be zero because if they were zero, you would immediately know that you can't be equivalent to an identity matrix.
So then we assume one of them is non-zero if it's this one and not this one.
Well, then we interchange rows to make this one the one that's non-zero.
Because these labels at the beginning of which entries I called a through, I were arbitrary,
when you do those row interchanges, you could be switching those entries. So the overall expression that we're getting will still work.
Other questions, yes, Inoko. No.
Which entry, Gabrielle Xeros. D So that's interesting, but these entries could be non-zero so that my overall expression becomes non-zero.
Yeah, so it's not quite true, I could have like DNG both being zero and still have the overall thing be convertible.
It would depend on the other entries like. Yes.
Yeah, so if you if you did the same thing for two by two,
we could make this thing roll call once the identity matrix and then that would suggest the entry that we want to look for,
to characterize inheritability would be a A.B.C. That's one way of getting at that notion of A.B.C. being important.
So, again, the exact calculation here is not the thing to get hung up on.
The point is that we're trying to do a calculation to inform what the definition would need to be.
OK, so I have not yet given you a definition of the determinant. I'm trying to define what it should be in order to do what we want.
So for a three by three, we could use this formula. In fact, this is the formula that's often given in a previous algebra class.
And you just say this is what it is. There's no motivation given at all. So I'm just trying to see where that formula might be coming from.
So now we can use an iterative formula to define the determinant for any size matrix.
So I want to give a little bit of notation here. When you delete a particular row and column, this is called The Minor of a Matrix.
So when I delete the first row and first column, this is called the one one minor of your matrix.
When I delete the first row and second column, this is called the one to Minor.
And when you delete the first row and the third column, this is the one three minor of a matrix.
So in this expression, we could rewrite the determinant of my three by three matrix to be equal to a times the determinant of what I'll
call a one one minus B times the determinant of a one two plus C times the determinant of a one three where.
Ay ay, Jay is the eye, Jay.
Minor. Of a. Which is obtained by.
The leading. The I throw.
And I throw and jth column.
So that suggests a way of defining this overall function that I want.
Again, it's very much an open question to prove that this new function, this new definition does what you want,
but at least it's verified computationally for one by one, two by two and three by three matrices.
It does what we want. So now definition.
For and greater than or equal to to the determinant.
Of an by and Matrixx A. Which is entries are just called AJ is given by the following formula.
So we've defined a two by two matrix, so a three by three will be fine in terms of two by twos,
a four by four we define in terms of three by threes and so forth.
So the determinant of your overall matrix A will be iteratively constructed from smaller size determinants.
So this will be a one one times the determinant of the minor obtained from deleting the first row and column from your matrix.
Then I'm going to do an alternating sum, just like I did there.
So minus a one two times the determinant of the matrix obtained from deleting the first row and second column.
So note these determinants are then of one size smaller. So I'm just doing an iterative construction.
So I'm saying what the determinant of an end by N Matrix in terms of and minus one by N minus one.
So plus. Oops, I forgot my sign.
One plus an. One and.
So we just continue that formula, alternating sign all the way down, so if you want, you can certainly write this in Sigma notation.
A one J times the determinant and the minus sign again, minus one to the one plus J times the determinant of a one J.
So this is now how I'm defining the determinant. So if you're asked to define the determinant, this is what I mean.
Jonathan, we're not moving this, this, that is.
We outlined earlier.
You should verify computationally that if I do it for a three by three, that it's exactly this formula, but that's an offer to buy two for the others.
I haven't defined anything. And so this is the definition. So we're close to it.
Yes, we're defining it like these. Yes, so the peranich was two and three, we have an explicit formula in terms of the coefficients.
It's not a formula that I would ever commit to memory unless you feel like it. I mean, for a two by two, you need to know it.
But for this formula, you could have I mean, some people have mnemonics for remembering this and so forth.
But have you ever wanted a computer? You could just compute it using the definition, using this expression.
What I'm saying.
Yes, convertibility, yes, that's still open, that's a theory and we need to prove so I'm now giving a definition like one of our major objectives.
We're proving that this definition does what we want.
The reason why I suspect that it does is because I derived this formula from explicitly working out.
And the unequals two case in the end equals three case. So that was my attempt to get motivation for where this formula would come from.
Arjan. Other questions, yep.
Computing a determinant? So that's a good question.
So that's one reason why you might want multiple definitions of something.
So like certainly like coming up with a more efficient way of computing, a determinant,
it is an attractive thing to want to think about how you could get at that.
This is a computation, though, that we could definitely just do one thing.
You'll note like this was mildly unpleasant for us to do, but RO operations are very quick for a computer to do so.
One thing that you could do is you could use RO operations to compute your determinants and that's a computationally efficient way to do it.
But we just need to prove that that still does what we want, that it agrees with this definition.
So it kind of goes back to the philosophy of this course. This definition is useful from some perspectives.
It's not useful from other perspectives, just like when we were talking about linear algebra in general.
We want in many ways of thinking about the same object because maybe computationally one method is not very efficient,
but conceptually it does give us some efficiency. So here we'll do the same thing where this method, this definition will give us some mileage,
but then we'll get other ways of thinking about the determinant as well. Does that answer your question, other questions?
Yes. If yes, how to find the cool factor.
So a bit more terminology, I suppose we can also talk about the cool factor expansion.
So here's my determinant, perhaps before I define the cool factor, as Tommy wants me to it,
it does appear in your notes maybe it would help with some of the questions that
seem to be circulating around the room to do an example of actually doing this.
So let's compute it. So let's go back to my favorite matrix.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, please don't be shy in asking questions.
If there are questions, it's better to just ask them.
Well, rather than just having your own conversations, because that makes it hard for everyone to hear.
Yes. We only go across the first row, yeah, we're only going across the first row,
the other entries in your matrix will certainly show up in these smaller determinants,
though, because like this stone won't have any of the entries in the first row.
And I'll just add all the entries further below that in The Matrix. Yes.
How could a computer computer determine it by rote reduction, I'll prove some properties of doing how doing raw operations changes your determinant,
and then from that we will know how the determinant will change.
And then we can just read it off from the end of the day from doing those RO operations. So we haven't gotten there yet.
That's a good question. We'll get back to that, Tommy.
Yes, Debbie. That's a property I haven't proven yet. But yeah, I mean, you could iterate through the columns as well.
So your good questions are sort of jumping ahead of exactly where we are.
I think some people are still talking about the definition. Are there other questions?
People just talking about the quiz, what's going on with studying something else?
No one wants to listen to me. It's OK for Dusty.
At least you're all awake, that doesn't always happen.
It's funny, I'll tell you what, my only math joke, so.
So my actual title in many academics are title is a lecturer,
and so the funny thing about the job title of a lecturer is that some people talk in their sleep, but lecturers talk and other people sleep so well.
Hopefully that doesn't happen too often here. I understand sometimes you're coming off of an all nighter, but.
All right. So here, if I want to compute the determinant of this, I literally want to use this definition.
So what does that say to do? It says take the one one entry so one finds the determinant of the one one minor.
So that means you delete the first row and first column. So you get five, six, eight, nine, then minus the one two entry.
So two times the determinant of four, six, seven, nine, and then plus the one three entry,
three times the determinant of now the two by two matrix four or five seven eight.
So that's literally me just following the symbols around to compute this thing, first of all, like knowing what you know about this matrix,
what do you expect the determinant should come out to be if it's doing what we hope it does?
Why? Someone said, zero, why? They're linear.
Are they linearly independent or are they not linearly independent, they're what?
They're linearly dependent. So the environment matrix, they're able to tell me this matrix is not inevitable.
So if this if this expression that I've defined has any merit at all, this had better come out to be zero.
So let's make sure it does. I hear some skepticism.
I feel like the class doesn't believe me whether it will come out to be zero or not.
Yes. Well, that's a good question.
So who answered the question who I mean, why would you know that these columns would be linearly dependent?
How could you check if you didn't see that? Tommy. Accused of personal.
Uh huh. Mm hmm.
So there'll be a zero, so if you started doing the reduction here, you would get a row of zeros, so then you know that there's a free variable.
So the Matrix Equation X equals zero has infinitely many solutions.
So then, you know, the vector equation involving the three columns then has a non-trivial dependent's relation.
Good question. OK, so let's actually do this computation.
So what do we have one times then. Here I have forty five minus.
What do we have here. Forty eight.
Then my next entry will be minus two times thirty six, minus forty two, plus three times thirty two, minus thirty five.
So this looks like it's giving me negative nine. This looks like it's giving me negative three, so that's negative 12 already.
So then right here I get then negative six times, negative two.
So positive 12. So, hey, good. It does work out. So there's at least some evidence that this is doing what we want.
So again, this is not a proof by any means that this crazy definition of a determinant actually encodes the property that we want.
We only have some evidence and for some small matrices, I think Caleb's going to yell at me in a minute.
So. In my last little bit of time, I guess maybe I'll just try to clean up some low hanging fruit here in terms of some terminology.
So as Tommy pointed out in this expression, we have cofactors.
So that's this included with the sign. That's what we call the IJA ko factor.
So let me just make sure that terminology appears in your notes. So we have miners and cofactors, so the I j.
Cool factor, cool factor. Of The Matrix is just that expression, which I'll refer to as C, J,
minus one to the I plus J times the determinant of the minor obtained from deleting the I throw and jth column.
So in this case, we're doing then this cool factor, expansion of the first row,
so the determinant that in terms of cofactors is equal to this expression,
a one one one one plus a one to see one, two plus da da plus a one and see one.
And so it's incorporating the sign along with those smaller determinants.
But it's not taking the entries, Arjun. Because I can do this for any road, not just the first row, just like reminders,
I don't necessarily have to delete the first row in a matrix to give the minor,
but I can delete any row and get the minor according to deleting that row.
And which leads me to maybe the next theorem is that if you do this expansion along any row or column, you'll get the same thing.
So that's cool. Factor expansion along any row or column will give you the same thing. So that's where I guess I should pick up with things next time.
So again, for your piece that that's due on Wednesday, all you need is the definition of determinates.
So you need this expression and that should be all that you need to work with it.
Yes. Hold on.
I can't hear the question. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Because that one is only across, Jay is one, it's across the first row in the cool factor, I can do any row.
Yeah. All right, please put away your notes.
Let's take this quiz. All right, please put away your cell phones, your notes, please don't turn away, turn over the quiz until it's time.
