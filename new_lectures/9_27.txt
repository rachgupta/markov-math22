Let's go to get started. Sorry I'm getting a little bit of a late start today.
Lots of great questions. Let's go to get started. Sorry I'm getting a little bit of a late start today.
Lots of great questions. So just in terms of some reminders, we have problems at four coming up,
if you've looked at it, you'll note that it is a fair bit shorter than problems at three.
So hopefully that makes your week a little bit more manageable. Mid-term one these tonight, six to eight p.m.
Oh, yes. Excited. Yes.
So it will be tonight, six to eight p.m. in science in our Holby, unless you've arranged otherwise to for other reasons.
But for the bulk of us, we should be there in the science center.
Are there any questions before we get started on sort of logistics that are coming up? Any questions?
Yes, I'll bring scratch paper.
The exam is also printed single sided, so if you have other work,
you would like to show where your solution goes beyond the white space provided then working on the back of a page is the best thing to do.
Yes, I think you probably should not arrive directly at 6:00 because we'll start at 6:00, so you end up losing time to, like, getting situated.
But I've been told the room is not used for anything.
I mean, well before we're in there. So you should be able to go in a fair bit before.
I mean, I will probably go down there something like 20 minutes earlier or something just to make sure that I have time to get set up.
Yes. I just I mean, come ready to do some thinking.
So, I mean, make sure you're, I don't know, well hydrated.
I mean, have some orange juice beforehand. So you're feeling good? Yes.
I'll probably turn on the Science Center projector to just project the time, so then you can just see it.
Yeah, that's what I usually do on the Science Center. Yeah.
You know, I don't actually know if there will be a pencil sharpener, and if you ask me, I won't I don't generally have pencils,
so it's probably a good idea if you if you really want to use a pencil to bring it back up one.
I suppose if you ask me for something to write with, I'll give you a pen, because that's all I really like to write with other questions you can have.
I mean, I don't I don't know if I have a strong opinion on whether you have your bag with you or not.
Your phone should not be out at any point during the exam.
So just make sure you keep don't keep pulling out your phone to check the time or something or project the time.
So there should be no issue. Other questions, anything I can help with now.
So you know exactly what to expect. Yes. Solving this is like the new system, how much writing you want to accomplish, like the absolute.
That's a great question. It does depend specifically on the question how much writing I would expect to justify your answer for that question.
I mean, typically for me, I don't necessarily need to see like this step.
I performed this RO operation to get to this next thing. I mean, I don't really care, like, just show me the reduction.
I mean, however you end up doing it, I mean, it might help to have, like, at least some kind of a sentence outlining your basic logic,
especially if the problem you're doing is you're solving it in some kind of a nonstandard way,
maybe a summary sentence at the end, if it's appropriate for the question.
But if it's just like solve this system of equations, I mean, there's not that many words you would need for a problem like that.
I mean, you might say like we form the augmented matrix.
I mean, even if you look at the solutions I posted there, not that many words and solutions of that type, that type of problem.
I mean, they're the more conceptual problems certainly require more justification.
I mean, for instance,
one of the practice exam questions is like show that these two or find all values of age where these two spanning sets are equal.
Well, then, of course, you need to show some work there to how your what your strategy is like,
why, you know, one set is definitely contained in the other just by the definition of a span.
So then you only really need to determine whether the other I think in that problem, the right hand span,
right hand side span is included in the left hand side and then you form an augmented matrix and you reduced to be able to do that.
So it really depends on the question how much justification I would need to see.
Other questions. I mean, my general advice on something like that is like I would just take the exam, go through it,
and then when you are sort of making your next your second pass through the exam to look things over,
think about like whether any steps invoke something that needs to be justified or I mean,
are there places where you're using a problem, said, well then right by problem set.
If you're using something from class, say we proved in class, I mean things like that to make it clear.
Otherwise you might have the greater right. Something like why? How do you know that's true?
So you want to then justify what you're saying? That's especially true in the Proops. OK, then also.
Yep, like the one on the. We have.
Just like. If you say what I wrote in class, then that should be sufficient.
Yeah, I mean, if you're, like, changing, I mean, you don't have to reproduce them like a scribe, for instance.
It does not have to be like exactly the same word in the same font that I used.
I mean, that might be difficult to reproduce.
You're not like a photocopier, so it should be quickly, logically equivalent to what I wrote down, not through using any theorems from the class.
So I think Tommy gave a good example of this earlier when he asked about the definition of linear independence.
Could you instead just say the Matrix equation X equals zero has only the trivial solution?
Well, that is definitely not the definition. There is another definition in the way of that, too.
Linear independence. That is certainly something that we all know and we've been working with a lot.
But that's not the definition.
So you'd want to make sure that you're giving actual definitions, not something that we prove is equivalent to the definition.
OK. Other questions, concerns. So makes sense.
All right, fruit. So the last day of linear algebra that we had,
we were starting to combine together the more days that we've been having thinking
about functions and equivalence relations back with thinking about linear algebra.
So we then introduced a special class of functions called linear transformations or linear functions, and we started observing properties of these.
So these are the ones that sort of play nicely with our vector operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
So that's one reason why they're natural things to study in this context. So I just want to start with kind of a computational example.
Even from your I think this is example one on the handout that I gave you.
Another question that actually came up that I think is a good one that I'll just remind you of,
I often put more questions on the handouts than I can realistically cover in class.
This is deliberate so that you get some problems to practice with if you want to.
So I strongly encourage all of you to look at the problems that we don't get to.
The solutions are posted to all of those. So they're good ones to use. To check your understanding then.
That's true for today's class, too, that there are a few on there that I don't necessarily intend to get to.
OK, so here we're thinking about what data would you need to know about a linear transformation
in order to determine the entire behavior of that model or that linear function.
So let's suppose we have some linear function t going from in this case are two to our three.
So it takes inputs to real inputs and spits out three real outputs where given that it's linear.
So it's a very special function and we're given two data points.
We're given a T of one zero gets sent to the output vector five negative seven two and T of one zero one gets sent somewhere as well.
So T o zero one gets sent to the vector, negative three eight zero.
So maybe we've done these experiments. We've measured for these inputs.
We get these outputs. So we then just like to know, does this determine our function?
Is this enough to know exactly what the behavior is everywhere or not?
So the question is, can we determine from these two data points the entire behavior of your function, of your model?
OK, so let's think about how we could approach a question like this.
Well. We want to just generally use the skills of being a good problem solver,
so we have something that we're given and we want to connect it back to the things that we know.
Subquestion. A.
Perfect, right? So because it respects tradition, we can put these together, so for instance, here, since T is linnear.
We can use the following observation.
So if T is linear, we can break up the vector AB in terms of one zero and zero one,
so then T of the vector A B is equal to T of the vector A times one zero plus the scalar B times the vector zero one.
So we've then taken this arbitrary vector in our two and written it as a linear combination of one zero and zero one.
Now because T is a linear function, it's very special. It's kind to both vector addition and scalar multiplication.
They're friends. They get along. And so we can distribute the tea across the vector addition and pull the scalars
through to then get T eight times out of one zero plus B times T of zero one.
And this is by linearity of T. OK, well, now we know what he does to these two particular vectors,
so then this will just be equal to eight times the vector five negative seven two plus B times the vector, negative three eight zero.
What's another way of writing this? We have a particular linear combination.
How could we express that, Tommy? We could think of it as an element in the span of these two vectors.
How else could we think about it? Gwen.
Combined, the. Perfect, right, we can also think about this as a matrix times the vector ab,
so this would be then the matrix five minus seven to minus three eight zero times the vector AB, because that's how we define vector addition.
We use this vector to say how much of a weight are you putting on the first vector?
How much weight are you putting on the second factor and take that linear combination of those two vectors?
So then just given these two data points, were then able to determine the entire behavior of our function because it's linear?
Certainly that would not be true. If it were a non function, we could not then just say exactly what it's going to do to other inputs.
So this also tells us that this particular linear transformation is that a matrix transformation?
It's just equal to a matrix times, a given vector.
So a question that we had hanging over us from last time was we saw that all matrix transformations are linear transformations,
but we didn't know the converse. Is it true that all linear transformations are matrix transformations?
So are all linear transformations.
All linear functions, also matrix transformations.
Well, this sort of warm up problem hopefully gives us some ideas of how we could carry that out.
So our first theme of the day will answer this question for us. This theorem ten in your textbook if you want to have a number attached to it.
That if you have a linear transformation te going from our NT to our M.
So this is linear. Then there exists, right, in other words, there exists.
A unique. What size should this matrix have?
What size? And by nd so remember, the number of rows should match with the number of outputs,
the number of columns should match the number of inputs, so then it should be an MBA and matrix.
So existing, unique and by and matrix a such that.
T X is equal to a times X for all X in the domain of my function.
So just some terminology before we prove the theorem, we call this unique matrix a the standard matrix,
so we call a standard matrix or the associated matrix.
Standard matrix. Or associated.
Matrixx. Of T, since that's unique, we can define it specifically for a given linear transformation, so this will be a specific answer.
So then the class of linear transformations will be exactly the same as the class of matrix transformations.
These are both describing the same kind of objects.
OK, so now I want to prove this theorem.
So we're getting to the point in the semester where we're all starting to get more comfortable writing proofs and so or maybe we're not,
but we will over the next few weeks if we're not yet. And part of getting comfortable writing proofs is to practice starting.
This is one of the hardest things when you're first learning to write proofs is to get started.
This is one reason why I'm giving relatively quick timed quizzes is to try to get feedback on that process of getting started.
And also one reason why I like to pause in class to give you a moment to think about how you would prove something yourself.
So I want to do that here. I want you to just take a minute or two yourself thinking about how would you prove this theorem.
If you've done the reading and you've already read a proof of this, don't just try to think and remember,
try to think about if you are approaching this yourself for the first time, what would the argument look like?
How would you start? What would you do? So I just want to see some ideas of how to get started.
OK, so just take like two minutes and then we'll prove it together.
But these individual exercises are really important for getting started, writing proofs to develop those skills to get started.
There's no substitute for practice. So make sure you write down at least one idea concretely, how are you going to start this?
All right, let's come back together now, you've had a moment to think about it.
Does anybody have a suggestion? How could we start? So.
I would like to go with meet with the.
So there are some great ideas there. I mean, you say like we should use an example one, right?
We want to use the idea of this problem. So generally speaking, when you're thinking about a new problem ahead of you,
if you had no idea how to approach this problem and if you just if you never see problems that you have no idea how to approach,
then that just means you're not solving hard enough problems. OK, everyone gets to that stage where you see some problems.
You have no idea how to start. If you have no idea how to start a problem, make it concrete, OK,
pick some numbers and actually work with that problem with some instance of that problem and try it out.
This is good advice for the midterm tonight as well. If I give you a proof of a counterexample problem, you're not sure if it's true.
You're not sure if it's false. Try to write down an example. OK, that's how I could get started.
Don't just stare at it. Think about how you could get started playing around with it.
So I think this is a great suggestion going back here to this previous problem that we've seen.
We could write an arbitrary element in our two in terms of one zero and zero one.
So maybe we could generalize that idea to this context as well.
The other suggestion I have for getting started on a problem like this is you first need to write the word proof.
Or at least abbreviate it, so here I want to write the word proof.
I also want to start with the things that I'm given. I want to introduce some notation into this problem.
So let's suppose we have a function T that's linear like this.
So suppose we have T going from our NP to our M.
Suppose this function is linear.
So it's the kind that we have in this problem in front of us and we want to know what T does to an element in its domain.
So let's give a name to that element. So let's take X to be the vector X one down to X and inside of R and.
So so far, all I did was introduce some notation based on the hypotheses that we have in this given problem.
Now we can use Haleys Theorem suggestion, rather, of going back to this previous example.
Our Vector X is just like the vector AB. So we want to write the Vector X as a linear combination of some nice vectors.
Well, in this case, the nice vectors are going to be the ones where you have a one say in the first part,
followed by a bunch of zeroes, one in the second spot and zeros everywhere else and so forth.
So let's give names to those. So let's define the vector E j.
So this will be notation that persists throughout this class and even in other classes.
This will be called the standard unit vector in our end. So it'll be zeros.
Followed by a one. And the GS position.
OK, so it's just a vector where zeros everywhere, except for in the jth component, you have a one.
That's what this vector is. So then note the Vector X can be written as a linear combination of these things.
So I just take X one times, E one was X,
two times E to start at X and and so there is my arbitrary element in the domain written as a linear combination of these particular vectors.
OK, well, hence we can now apply t to both sides of this equation, so then we know T of the Vector X is equal to T of X one, E one plus X n e n.
Now what? Even just following the idea from the previous computation we did.
And what would we do you. Perfect right now, will you use linearity so this becomes x1 Hymes T of E one plus X and T of N and this is by linearity.
So by the definition of linearity, we're allowed to do that, OK?
Yes. I know we can always apply the same function to both sides and get something that's equal, I mean,
that would be from the definition of a function that if you're applying a function to two things that are equal, you will get the same output.
So that seems maybe too granular to go back to.
But that's a good question. If you didn't want to do that, you could just start with T of X and then plug in what X is into that, so.
OK, now what? Oh, yes, Jonathan.
By definition. The X Factor.
So. But you could define it in words, I mean, I think this is still a perfectly fine definition.
You could say you could define it piecewise if you wanted,
so you could define it in words to be the vector of all zeros except for one in the position.
That would be a sentence that defines it. In terms of notation. You could write this where you clearly indicate the one is in the position.
If you want to define it piecewise, you could also define it piecewise as a function that way.
So that. Yes.
So there should be any other questions.
Yes. Because not all functions distribute across your function will distribute like this,
I mean, it has to be because the function is linear, that I'm allowed to do this.
So it's not that I'm multiplying the T as a function.
So if like T were squaring or something. Right, it wouldn't do this.
You get cross terms. It's a good question.
So remember, linear functions are special. They're nice. So by definition of matrix multiplication,
then we would have T of the vector X is then these are now elements in R m and you're taking a linear combination of vectors in our M.
So then by definition this will be the matrix T of E one to T of E n.
So you'll note that there columns here, each of them living inside of our M times, the vector X one down to exact.
So then we just take that to be a so and this is equal to a times the Vector X where A is equal to T of this vector E one up to T of this vector.
And so knowing where this vector E one goes through and through the vector N where the linear transformation sends each of those vectors,
tells you what the matrix has to be. What's missing from my proof.
What's missing, what have I not addressed. Well.
So. The uniqueness part is certainly not present, so I have shown that one exists.
I found one, I found a matrix A that will do the job, but I've definitely not addressed uniqueness at all.
So we do need to think about uniqueness. OK, so we've shown existence, now we want to prove uniques.
So one common strategy for proving uniqueness is to suppose you have another one and then show that they're equal.
So that's what we're going to do. So suppose we have another Matrix B that does this job.
So B is an MBA and matrix. Such that.
T of X is equal to the Times, X for all X in the domain.
So be is another matrix that expresses this as a matrix transformation, let's give names to the columns of this matrix.
Oh, it was odd. It wasn't just me.
Right. OK. OK, good.
I'm glad it wasn't just all right.
Start seeing spots, it's worrying. OK, all right, so we'll give names of these things so we have an MBA and Matrix,
so we need to name the end columns where B.K. is an element in our what are these in R.M. because it's an MBA and matrix.
So what we'd like to show is that The Matrix A is the same as The Matrix B, right.
That's the goal. OK, well.
Let's start with one of the columns, say, column B.K., how could I get the case column out of this matrix?
What could I multiply by in order to get the case column out?
That's Brendan. What? Oh, I'm sorry, I was looking at Brendan and then go ahead, E.J.
Yes, sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Brendan. I was looking at you, and then I saw your hand up.
Look, so be it, OK?
Right. So that's one way to get the kids column out, OK?
Question. All right, so then this is then plugging in to the same thing, tea, because that's how what BP was supposed to do.
Well, you know, tea is also represented by the Matrix A.
So this is a times E. Well, what does this do to a.
It says, take the linear combination of the columns where you apply a zero weight to every column except for the case one,
so then it pulls out the case column of The Matrix at. So hence, Matrix B has all of the same columns as The Matrix.
So then they're the same matrix. Questions.
Seems like there might be questions. Yes.
After the event here, sure. So what I want to do, the goal and what I'm doing next is I want to show that the Matrix B is equal to The Matrix.
Two columns or two matrices are equal if they have exactly the same columns.
So that's what I'm trying to do. I want to show that the cave column of B is equal to the column of air.
So I start out with the column of B and I say, well, how is that related to the Matrix B?
Well, it's the Matrix B times the vector where you apply zero weight to every column except for the case one.
So then B times vector X is just the column of the Matrix.
B, then I say, well what is this in terms of T will be was assumed to be the matrix that I could multiply by to represent
any of the any of the linear transformation t so that's the same thing as T applied to this vector.
But then the whole point was the A was also a matrix that did this job where it
would just be multiplying by that matrix to express the output of this function.
So then that's equal to a times. OK, but again, just the same reasoning is before, if you take the vector X times the matrix A,
that's then applying zero weight to every column except for the case one.
So then it pulls out the case column. So then the column of A is the same as the case column of B, therefore the matrices are equal.
And it's unique, which I think was a question maybe Arjuna's last time was whether there were other ways to represent a given linear transformation.
So it makes sense questions. We're good.
Yes. Oh, you're good.
Yes, Xabier, linear transformation, yes, by the properties that we've seen already of Matrix properties, we're multiplying matrix by a vector.
They're all linear. Yep. Yeah, we can't divide by a matrix.
Yeah, there's we don't have any method of dividing by matrices or dividing by vectors, so we can only use the operations that we have in front of us.
Other questions. Oh, yes.
Oh. So if there were another one be, then I would have to be the same as a right.
So then there's only one. Because you already have this one A then I say, suppose there were some other there was another one,
I call it B, well, then B would have to be equal to this one. So then there's only this one.
Other questions. OK, so as we're getting more into the linear algebra of the semester, we'll answer more proofs of the results in linear algebra.
So this will give us exercise in both developing our proofreading strategies where we're then exercising is getting started writing proofs,
which is often the hardest part. So I'll often do this where we pause and try it ourselves.
OK, I think it's a really good way to get going. OK.
All right. So example two on your hand out now, I would like to write down some use some of these ideas,
so let's suppose we have tea to be the linear transformation from R to to R to that's going to rotate by theta and a counterclockwise direction.
And I would like to find the matrix associated with this. I want to find a rotation matrix so we now know that there's exactly one of them and we can
find the matrix of any linear transformation just by computing what it does to end vectors.
So here there are two of them. There's the vector one zero and the vector zero one. I rotate both of them by theta.
I see what happens to them. That tells me the rotation matrix. So let's just do it.
So here, I'll write my domain. I should use my colors here.
So if we have the vector E one one zero.
And I have the vector E to the vector zero one.
Now I want to rotate both of these by theta and a counterclockwise direction.
So then I'm going to get here will be T of E one.
So that'll make an angle of theta. And then I'll get over here t e two, which again, that will make an angle of theta with the positive y axis.
So I just need to think about where those go. Well, we can do some trigonometry.
So this vector we're rotating by, we're taking the vector one zero six on the unit circle.
We rotate by theta. So then this is just going to the point cosine theta sine theta.
Well, this is just doing the same thing, same problem, but rotated into the second quadrant.
So then my x axis here is then going to be minus the Y here.
So then it'll be minus sign theta and then this the the amount we go up is the amount that we went over here, the x coordinate here.
So then that will just be cosine theta. So then in yellow t e to be minus sine theta.
Cosine theta. So that means my Matrix A. will be the matrix cosine theta sign data, minus sign data, cosine data.
So if we want to rotate by an arbitrary angle theta, we can now just multiply by this matrix.
What if I want to rotate around the Z axis in our three, then what would I do?
We have a three by three, right, if I'm rotating around the Z axis in our three.
What would happen to the vector zero zero one? What happened to that, I'm like, here's my Z axis, I'm rotating around this one.
What's happening to that vector? So much to answer before I get dizzy. Nothing.
So I'm just going back to the same vector. I still got dizzy. So. So then our rotation matrix would be a three by three matrix where I would have this
in the upper left corner and then I would have zero zero one for my third column.
So we can think about this is often very useful in computer graphics. We have a lot of other geometric transformations as well.
We can think about a reflection across an axis. So maybe a few more dramatic transformations.
So we could take one, let's reflect, you can reflect across an arbitrary line,
you could even imagine reflecting across a plane and our three the same idea for finding the Matrix work and all of those cases.
But let's just take an easy one and reflect across the x axis. Maybe not easy, but at least an early example.
So if we want to reflect across the X axis, we want to do it in our too well.
We just take our two unit vectors again are two vectors, one zero zero one.
I apply this reflection transformation.
Well, T of E won on that line, you reflected across, you get the same thing then when I reflect the other one down, I'll get T of E two.
So that means the matrix that reflects across the standard matrix of this transformation.
T will be one zero zero minus one.
Multiplying by that matrix then gives me reflection across the x axis.
Similarly, you could reflect across the Y axis,
you could reflect across a line like Y equals X. What would that matrix look like if you reflected across the line?
Y equals X? Or the matrix of that transformation be?
How would we even figure it out if you don't know? You.
That's exactly right. So, I mean, I would just this all start the same way, take the vector one zero.
See what happens with that vector.
When I reflect across the line, Y equals X, if you reflect that vector across a line Y equals X, what would you get?
Yeah, 01 one writes, Your first column of your matrix will then be zero one.
Similarly, if I take the vector here one zero one and then I reflect across, it goes to one zero.
So then my matrix becomes zero one one zero in terms of reading the columns.
OK, so just a few geometric transformations. We now have a rotation and reflection operations as well.
I want to tie this back together with what we were doing last class or two classes ago, I suppose,
which is determining whether or not your linear transformation and now your matrix transformation will be interactive or subjective.
So the question we want to determine now is given a linear transformation t going from,
say, r nt to r m, how can we determine if it's inductive or subjective?
T is inductive or subjective. So, I mean, if you were given a question like this on an exam or a piece that you just had no idea.
My first suggestion to you would be we'll try it in a really concrete problem, try it in a very specific instance of the problem.
So that's what I want to do an example for. Let's take this matrix going from our for to our three given by T of X, multiplied by the Matrix,
where hey again, the domain number of components has to match with the number of columns.
So I need four columns. The number of output components has to match with my number of rows in a three by four matrix
and I take the one one minus four eight one zero to minus one three zero zero zero five.
Now I want to ask both of these questions in turn, whether it's inductive or subjective.
All right. So remember, for subjectivity.
We want to determine if we're given an arbitrary element in the QUARTERMAIN, in our three,
that there's some choice of weights for the columns so that that element in the QUARTERMAIN is mapped to by that element in the domain.
OK, so we saw last time,
I think this was maybe Arjun's observation was that the range of this linear transformation or the image would be the span of the collapse.
So we already know from last class that the range or the image of T is equal to the span of these columns.
So one zero zero minus four to zero eight, minus one zero and one three five.
OK, so if I'm looking at the span of these these span, all of our three, do these four vectors span all of our three.
Do you think? Yes, how do you know that?
There's a pivot position in every row when you form the augmented matrix,
if you augmented this three by four matrix with an arbitrary vector B. over here,
then you have a pivot here, you have a pivot here and you have a pivot here.
So there's a pivot position in every row.
So we've proven before in class that if you have a pivot position in every row, then the Matrix Equation X equals B would always be consistent.
And therefore these columns that span all of our three. We've proved in class that having.
A pivot in each row.
The pivot position in each row, we have a pivot position in each row, then the equation X equals B is always consistent and X B is always consistent.
Hence, T.S.A. If this were a more complicated matrix, you might need to do some work to see that there's a pivot in every row,
but because it's a relatively simple form, we can see the pivots immediately.
OK, so now let's think about injectivity and then we can try to make some more general observations.
So if we wanted to see injectivity. All right, so looking at this matrix, can you tell me about injectivity?
If the function were injected, how many elements could map to zero? There would have to be more than one element mapping to zero.
How can you see that from The Matrix? Yes.
There's not a pivot in every column, right, we have that free variable, so the Matrix Equation X equals zero will then have infinitely many solutions.
So there's a lot of elements that mapped to zero. So therefore, this is not an objective function.
So note. X equals zero has a free variable.
Again, so from early work on the class and hence.
There are infinitely many solutions.
Bus tea is not indicative because being injected should mean that there should be at least one element that will map to the zero vector.
OK. Well, now let's try to prove something more generally that we can use,
we have a nice example that should inform how our troops should look, but let's try to actually prove it now.
So this is theorem 11, so again, let's take T to be a linear transformation from our end to our M.
So the associated matrix will be M by N, let's take it to be linear because this result won't be true if it's non-linear.
It's a good exercise for you to think through. What if you had a nonlinear function? How would this fail then?
The conclusion is that T is ineffective or one to one.
If and only if T of X equals zero has only the trivial solution.
Again, it's a good exercise in sort of developing improved writing skills to think about how would you start this?
How would you think about proving this statement, given the logical construction of the statement?
What two pieces of this proof? Do you immediately have to be there? Yes.
Perfect. Perfect, right?
So you would know this, the left statement implies the right statement or the right statement implies the left statement.
So we're already sort of unpacking what the structure of the argument looks like.
Once you start seeing like if you want to prove two sets are equally sure, each is a subset of the other.
When you start seeing those big pieces of how the argument needs to look, the overall thing becomes a lot more manageable.
So let's actually try to actually prove it together now. So we'll exactly use this strategy.
So, again, proof so it doesn't really matter which one you want to do first, let's prove left implies right.
So suppose she goes from Aaryn to R.M. is injected in linear.
OK, so that's our function. So now what I want to prove is that T of X equals zero has only the trivial solution.
OK, well, since the functions linear, what can you tell me about T of zero?
It has to be zero, right, so sensitive is linear.
We know or we've previously proved to be of zero is equal to zero, so that means we already have the trivial solution to this particular equation.
So thus X equals zero is a solution to T of X equals zero.
All right, well, so we wanted to prove that not only do we have the trivial solution, but we only have the trivial solution.
So if we want to prove that we only have the trivial solution, we could say, suppose we have another one.
Suppose. Why is a solution to T of X equals zero, so namely, t Y is equal to zero, then if we could prove Y has to be zero, we'd be done.
OK, well, now.
Oh, no, I break it. They warned me not to break it, like, don't break this, Dusty, OK?
So now we have. T of X or Y, rather, does equal to T of zero.
They both map to zero. What can you tell me about this? So since he is ineffective, then you can conclude the two inputs would have to be the same.
That's the definition of injectivity, that's the contrapositive form of the definition we got is equal to zero, hence.
Zero is the only solution. Yes.
You're still using the same argument because you're still it comes down to using injectivity to show any other one would have to be zero.
So at some point, you just need to invoke injectivity in some form.
All right, so let's move the other direction now, the other direction is a little bit more tricky.
I should leave it up. All right, so now we want to move this direction.
It's also an interesting statement to a nice, true or false question if you're thinking of them for, say, another quiz or exam.
So if you drop the word linnear, whether this statement is still true,
it's kind of a question that I would like to use in the past if you're looking for more practice problems.
Hint, it's not, but she come up with a counterexample.
All right, so now suppose T of X equals zero has only the trivial solution.
Now we want to prove he is. How does an injectivity proof usually start?
That's. Perfect, so suppose to vector X1 is equal to T a vector X two, so that's what I want to do.
So now I know things about linearity, so it seems like it makes sense to try to get them both on the same side of the equation.
So then we know that T vector x1 minus T a vector x2 is equal to zero by linearity we get T of X one minus X two is equal to zero by linearity.
And now this is the crucial stage where we're invoking the assumption.
What does the assumption allow us to conclude. Yes.
Go ahead. Next one is equal to zero, so since this only has the trivial solution, the only thing you could have plugged in to get this result is zero.
So that means X one, minus X two is equal to zero. So since.
We have only the trivial solution.
Then we know X one minus X two must be trivial and hence X one is equal to X to.
And the proof. So therefore, it's a. yes.
Jonathan playing.
Have a solution that I think will be absolutely fascinating and there's only one thing that people are going to.
Yeah, you'd also be using the theorem that we can work with the Matrix matrix of a linear transformation.
So the key point there is that we can translate any of our questions about linear functions now to be statements about matrices.
So that's sort of the underlying theme of today's class. And then you'd be invoking, I think, Mike's theorem.
I don't see Mike today for his theorem. No, he should be here to count up every time his theorem gets invoked.
Unfortunate. That's the dangerous part of getting a theorem named after you.
OK, so what I want to do is exactly summarize Jonathan's observation here.
So the key idea from today's class is the following.
You can study a linear transformation now t going from our NP to our M.
Well, this is linear by studying the matrix of a linear transformation.
So the key idea is now we've taken a question about functions that might be complicated or hard to work with,
and we've turned it into a question about matrices, which we have tons of tools to work with and understand.
So this is a common theme in all of mathematics.
What we try to do is to take some new object and related to our old objects, the things that we're comfortable with.
So when you're getting a question about linear transformations,
you want to turn that into a statement about matrices that you can then just answer using row reduction,
using vector equations, using matrix equations, using augmented matrices.
So kind of seeing that theme from the first week of the semester come back again.
So to summarize, that is really the following theory. It's a nice review of the first bit of this class to Siss Theorem 12.
It's proof is the proof of this theorem is really a nice exercise in just seeing the different theorems we've proved over the last few weeks come up.
So Theorem 12, a nice one that we might want to invoke if we have a linear transformation going from our end to our linear.
And he is the associated or standard matrix.
We know it's unique, there's just one matrix and we can get that matrix by just evaluating that linear transformation on these standard vectors,
each one through e end. And then we get these two statements. T is subjective if and only if the columns of a span are m the output space,
which again we know is a nice question in linear algebra of just how do you figure out whether the columns span R.M. or the new form,
the augmented matrix and see if there's a pivot in every row statement to T is injected.
It's one to one if and only if the columns are linearly independent.
They are linearly independent, so this was exactly the observation that Jonathan was making that we can now exactly translate
between statements about your linear function and statements about the associated Matrix columns.
OK, so that's really the key thing to take away from today's class.
If you're taking away, you want to think, well, what's what should we really remember?
The basic thing to remember is that we can study linear functions by studying.
The Associated Matrixx.
So every question you could ask about a function, I would like to ask the corresponding question about a matrix and vice versa.
So there's not too much to prove in this statement, but it's more of a summary because we've really done all these pieces before.
So for a let's just kind of summarize the ideas here.
So T is subjective or it's on to. Well, that's true.
If and only if we'll think about what the definition is for all be in our M,
there should exist in a little way in our NT such that t a little lay is equal to be right.
There is the definition of subjectivity for all elements in the domain.
There is an element in the domain such that Tiva is equal to be.
OK, well then translating this statement into a statement about matrices then means for all b in our M the matrix equation X equals B is consistent.
A particular solution would be a for instance,
but then we proved before that this matrix equation being consistent for ALBE is exactly the statement about the columns of a spanning arm.
So by previous theorem, that means that the columns of a span.
Columns of a span are, um, the Kotomi, so we've proven that before.
Questions on that. Similarly, the result on so if you want to know this part, if you want to really specify at every stage what's going on,
the first if and only if statement is by definition of subjectivity,
the second if and only if statement is by definition or by the theorem that
A is the associated matrix of T so that we can translate between those two.
So by the theorem we just proved and then the third one is from the theorem early in the semester
where we showed that the columns span R.M. if and only if the Matrix X goes B is always consistent.
OK, so let's do the other one and then I'm probably going to be out of time.
So, B., so, again, we've really set this up for most of the work has already been done for us and other results.
So T is now inactive or one to one if and only if by the previous theorem.
We just proved previous theorem today, if and only if T of X equals zero has only the trivial solution, only the trivial solution.
Right, it's only has a trivial solution, but if that equation has only the trivial solution,
again by the theorem that tells us that we can translate this into a matrix equation, then we know that X equals zero has only a trivial solution.
So if X equals zero has only the trivial solution,
then that means that the only way to write zero is a linear combination of the columns of the Matrix is to take weight zero for every column,
which is the definition of linear independence. So thus that means the columns of NG are linearly independent.
So we've really seen all of these results before, it's just a matter of assembling them together now and one argument.
So the key takeaway, if you're going to take things away from today's Class One,
we can study linear transformations by now studying the associated matrix.
You can find the associated matrix by evaluating your linear transformation on the standard vectors E one through E and so those sort of two things.
Then any question about linear transformations? We can study through the associated matrix, including the question of injectivity and subjectivity.
You can now ask just use whether the columns of the matrix span are M and whether the columns are linearly independent.
OK, so that's sort of the key summary. All right.
It looks like I'm oh, I'm not out of time, but I'll add two minutes early, so then I'll pay down my debt.
All right. I'll see all of you later tonight. Have a good Monday.
