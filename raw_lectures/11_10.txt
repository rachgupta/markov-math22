Let's let's go ahead and get started. So in terms of some announcements, so we're getting close to the end of the semester.
0:02
There's not that much more time left, so I just wanted to kind of outline what's remaining for us.
0:13
So there's one more quiz. There's three more problem sets and there's the final project.
0:20
So it's really we're getting close to the end here.
0:26
The bulk of the time that you put towards this class, I would encourage you to put towards your final project from basically now until it's due.
0:30
The problem sets are going to correspondingly get shorter to allow for you to have that time.
0:40
OK, it's not that the course is going to suddenly have a lot more time allocated to it.
0:45
In particular, I wanted to outline when the problem sets will be due.
0:51
So problems at 10. The one with their project proposal is due this Friday problems that 11 will then be due a week
0:55
from Friday and then the last problems that problems at 12 will be do the last day of class.
1:02
December 1st. OK, so. Just to kind of keep in mind what's coming.
1:09
There won't be quite as much proof of work to do on these problem sets, especially problems at 12.
1:17
This is then our problems that that's more focused on data analysis for the quantitative reasoning with data requirement.
1:25
So instead of poufy problems, there will be a few a handful of problems that require you to do some data analysis.
1:31
Using the tools will develop over the next few weeks. So that's that's what's coming.
1:38
OK. Just in terms of how to allocate your time and energy around this class,
1:46
it'll be a much more pleasant experience if you put in sort of small amounts of consistent work into your project rather than trying to,
1:51
like do everything the night before things or do. So the first big check in will be this Friday.
1:58
When you turn in your proposal again, this not you shouldn't feel a tremendous amount of pressure there.
2:06
We're just trying to encourage you to get started.
2:11
And so I encourage you to write your proposal in a way to maximize the quality of the feedback that you're getting.
2:13
So if there's something that you're worried about for your project, pose it as a question as a part of your project proposal,
2:20
saying, like, we're not really sure what we would prove as a part of this project.
2:26
We're having trouble finding a source that's written at a level we can really digest.
2:29
It's better to be upfront with your concerns early in the process,
2:33
rather than like coming to me on December 12th and being like, I can't really find a source to read.
2:37
Like, that's not the time. The next major check in point will be when you submit a draft, and that will be the last day of the semester.
2:41
So that will be December 1st. So when we the Wednesday, when we get back from Thanksgiving break, so that's when the more complete that draft is,
2:51
the more likely that you will have a get good feedback on the draft to know that
3:00
it's sort of going in the direction that we will evaluate highly with the proposal.
3:06
You'll be matched with ATF that will be sort of the person mentoring your project,
3:12
so the person you should feel free to reach out to with questions that will either be me or one of the four t.f grad students for the class.
3:16
So once you turn in that project proposal, then it's going to generate a bunch of peer review requests.
3:25
So you'll all do.
3:31
I think two peer reviews, you'll read some other people's projects and get some idea of like some really cool ideas other people are doing,
3:32
and that might give you ideas for your own project that is a part of your final project grade,
3:38
as well as giving quality, high quality feedback to your classmates.
3:44
OK. That'll happen on December 1st, then December 1st, the ones we're reading period starts December 2nd through about a week later.
3:49
You'll be asked to meet with the t.f that's reading your project to get more feedback, more direct direction of how to finish this thing.
3:59
OK, until it's do, the final project will be then be due December 13th.
4:07
So if you're thinking about like what the weather, what you're doing is appropriate for your project.
4:14
I mean, there are a lot of points to get feedback. Don't wait until the last minute for that to happen.
4:20
The project scores tend to be pretty high because people put in a lot of work, but I'll just throw out the warning that is not uniformly the case, OK?
4:26
The ones that usually score poorly are the ones that people start working on them the weekend before they're due.
4:35
And that usually is a recipe for disaster. So don't do that.
4:42
Consistent work regularly until the project comes will make this much less stressful.
4:46
But you should know that I'm happy to be a resource with projects along with all the seniors are happy to be resources.
4:53
I mean, go to office hours, ask questions. Even at this early stage, ask the seniors what they did.
5:01
The ones that took about 20 to what they did for their projects that will give you, I think, a lot of great ideas.
5:07
They've also seen a lot of the projects through the peer review process last year to.
5:13
So I just want to make sure we're all clear on what's happening. Tommy. I was thinking that piece at 11 would probably be posted a little bit later,
5:19
just because we still have piece that tend to on Friday and we switched to or be doing on due next Friday.
5:30
So I don't know if it'll be posted today. Maybe tomorrow it'll be posted.
5:38
Yeah, look. So you can every group member has to submit something on great scope.
5:44
You don't have to submit different proposals. This is just because of a quirk on great scope.
5:53
It's hard for us to group them together,
5:59
and it creates an administrative headache for us to like click through to find like, who actually submitted this thing.
6:01
So it's really very helpful for us if every group member just submits the proposal.
6:07
And then when you're working together, you probably want to look at each other's grade scope submission to see,
6:12
like what comments you actually got from your t.f reader.
6:18
Yeah. Just the final, I mean, I think the earlier you start talking things, the better.
6:22
But I mean, I'm not going to like. I want there will be no points taken off if the proposal is written in some other form.
6:33
I mean, the proposal might be more of an outline form anyway, so it's not as important that it's tacked.
6:43
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's one of several people emailed me about that, I'm sorry, I'll do that.
6:52
I teach right after this. As soon as I get back to my office, I'll do that. Yeah, sorry about that.
6:59
Tommy, go. Yep, that's after all.
7:04
So you won't do peer reviews on the proposals, you'll only do peer reviews on the drafts, so that will be December 1st.
7:11
So after the last day of the semester, then you'll get a canvas invitation to read two of your classmates projects.
7:17
It's on the syllabus, I don't remember off the top of my head, I think you have like four or five days to do that.
7:28
And to be honest, like that should not take very long.
7:33
I mean, it's really about like you reading and giving your thoughts like it's an important piece of feedback to say, I was super confused.
7:35
That's good for your classmates to know because you are the intended audience, so they should be adapting what they're presenting to the math.
7:41
Twenty two audience. OK, so I'm happy to.
7:52
As more questions sort of occur to you with the projects, I mean, I'm sure as you dove more into it,
8:00
you'll get more things you're curious about, but I'm happy to answer those questions as they come up.
8:05
So really, what the last bit of this course is about?
8:12
In some sense, we've covered the core of the material.
8:16
What we're doing now is what I view as kind of the capstone of this course.
8:21
We're going to kind of see some different directions. You can push the material in and also set the stage for a multivariable calculus course.
8:25
So thinking about either 20 to be or maybe a different calculus course, but hopefully 20 to be so,
8:34
but so thinking about building that geometric understanding of what we're doing so that we are prepared to do calculus.
8:43
So today, what I wanted to do is present one application of the things we've been doing.
8:51
So the starting point for this will be picking up with your second semester calculus class, either math one,
8:57
be here at Harvard or BSC Calculus, if you took that in high school or whatever experience you had with integral calculus.
9:02
So one of the main topics there is a little bit with differential equations.
9:12
So I wanted to present one application of what we've been doing to that kind of problem.
9:16
So let's just start with a classical problem in physics. So this is the situation of a simple harmonic oscillator.
9:22
Someone gets up to leave. Last year, when I did this lesson, I said the word simple harmonic oscillator and there was an audible groan from the class.
9:36
So it's already an improvement over last year. That's why I was pausing to wait to see if that was going to happen again.
9:48
So we have this mass on a spring, and the idea is we're modeling this in a frictionless way, at least to start with.
9:55
We'll consider this. Our displacement from this equilibrium position to be X equals zero.
10:02
And then we measure sort of positive displacement and negative displacement away from that equilibrium.
10:08
So if we just take the mass in the spring, it's placed at the equilibrium. Of course, it's not going to move.
10:13
You pull your mass, you let it go. It's going to start oscillating around that equilibrium position.
10:18
OK. You could also think about and then the way that you derive the equation governing this, you use Hooke's law in physics.
10:24
So you think about the spring constant.
10:32
I'm just going to choose my spring constant to be one in my mass, to be one to make things sort of clear or easy, rather.
10:33
So what's going to happen then, is we get the differential equation of X double prime of T is then equal to well,
10:41
you get pushed back to the equilibrium. So negative x of T.
10:48
So if you have some positive displacement, then we're being pushed back towards that equilibrium position.
10:55
Jonathan, I don't recall this and I don't recall what we haven't done anything yet.
11:02
There's nothing to recall yet. No, I don't recall it.
11:09
We're going forward in the course of how or will it be to recall things like this?
11:15
Recall things like what the latest harmonic oscillators were also different from the way.
11:20
Well, Jonathan, you have to give me a chance to say something before you object to everything.
11:29
So I guess I'm asking that you believe me if you don't want to think about physics at all or you've never taken a physics class,
11:40
I'm just asking that you believe me that the derivation of a simple harmonic oscillator will come from this particular differential equation.
11:47
So I don't particularly need you to remind. Remember that the derivation of Hooke's law,
11:57
it should feel somewhat intuitive that the idea that like my the acceleration I'm
12:03
going to feel will be the negative of the displacement I have from the equilibrium.
12:09
So, I mean, this is what I'm asking for your trust in the intuition behind how you would derive the behavior of a mass and a spring.
12:16
Do I particularly care about the behavior of a mass on a spring? Of course not.
12:24
The reason why you care about the behavior of a mass on a spring is because it's a representation of a lot of different types of problems,
12:28
whether it's inside of thinking inside of an atom,
12:35
or if you're thinking about something like that, a door like you want to close the door and have it not slam,
12:39
you're then modeling then a mass on a spring inside of that door. So like in terms of engineering applications, this idea comes up.
12:45
So I'm just presenting a place where this could appear.
12:53
I'm not asking that you have a precise knowledge of everything that happens in a physics course.
12:56
So the main point for us is this that you have as a starting point, a particular differential equation.
13:04
If you've never seen a differential equation before, it's just an equation involving derivatives.
13:10
OK. The main place that you've seen? Well, I claim everyone in here has seen differential equations before, even whether you've acknowledged that.
13:14
I mean, think back to like even your first semester of calculus, you think about exponential functions.
13:23
Well, that's just saying the rate of change is proportional to how much you have.
13:29
And that seems reasonable to model lots of things where when you have lots of something that it might be growing at a more or faster rate.
13:32
So we then use that x prime as equal to K times x to represent that kind of a situation.
13:41
This is, of course, not a full class in mathematical modeling to go into that particular direction.
13:48
And just trying to present a situation that might gather some nods of agreement from the class, but not necessarily always.
13:54
So if you don't particularly remember how you derive this differential equation, I'm happy to go through a physical derivation in, say, office hours.
14:05
If you don't care to see a physical derivation,
14:13
then I would just say the starting point is I want to find some function whose second derivative is equal to negative of the original function.
14:17
That's what it means to solve the differential equation. So you can certainly take it as a pure math problem.
14:24
So what we want to do. Because we want to find some function that satisfies this equation.
14:32
That's all we're doing when we solve a differential equation. OK.
14:40
Now I have to regain my train of thought. What are we actually doing here?
14:48
So if you think back to at least math one b at Harvard, the way that we approach solving a differential equation of this form is you make
14:55
and the way you often approach just in a general differential equations class.
15:04
Trying to solve a differential equation is you make an informed guess about what the solution might be and you try to find a solution of that form.
15:08
So I'm computing some derivatives,
15:18
so I would think that it might be convenient for me to work with some functions that are easy to compute the derivatives up.
15:20
So what you often do, or one possible approach is you could guess a particular solution.
15:29
So I'm going to guess an exponential solution to the RTI.
15:36
So then what that would mean is I want to know, is there some constant ah, that would make this a solution to the differential equation?
15:44
Well, to check that you would just plug it in. So I look at, well, what's acceptable prime.
15:51
So then that's going to be r squared e to the R t x of T is, of course, e to the R T.
15:57
So then that means X of T is a solution to x double prime plus X is equal to zero if and only if, if I when I plug this thing in, I would get zero.
16:05
So I have our squared e to the R T plus e t r t is equal to zero.
16:20
Now you factor, so I have our squared plus one b t r t is equal to zero.
16:27
So I need the product of two things to be equal to zero.
16:38
So either this is zero or this is zero, the exponential function is never zero.
16:41
So then that tells me that I have our squared r squared plus one is equal to zero.
16:46
So that tells me the zeros for this will be ours equal to plus or minus I.
16:54
The imaginary unit. So furthermore, that tells me that, say, X of T.
17:01
Well, maybe I'll call this x one being equal to any constant, say C one e to the I T plus c to D to the minus T.
17:10
Will be a solution. We all worked this out on two steps.
17:23
So in particular, that means the X1 of T is equal to e to the I t is a solution.
17:31
And X two of T is equal to the minus T is a solution.
17:41
So we found two solutions. The other thing you might notice is that if I scaled this solution by any real number, it's still a solution.
17:51
It still satisfies that differential equation. If I scale this solution, I would then get another solution.
18:01
If I add them, I get another solution. So in particular, if I take any linear combinations of these two, I get a solution.
18:07
So then we call that the general solution of T is equal to see one e to the I t, I'll see to it the minus.
18:14
I mean, this is the general solution. So in fact, all solutions to this differential equation will be of this form for some constant C one and C two.
18:24
The thing that's a little bit disappointing about this form is that it involves a lot of complex numbers.
18:36
And while I think complex numbers are fun to work with,
18:45
it seems a little bit strange that it involves complex numbers because we're talking about a mass on a spring.
18:49
So if you're thinking about what this is supposed to represent,
18:55
especially given that I might model this without any sort of friction that you would expect that this should just oscillate back and forth forever.
18:58
So I don't see anything there that really looks like oscillation. And what does it mean to be a complex number in that context?
19:07
That seems kind of strange in particular, given the physical scenario that I'm trying to Model X of T should be modeled by a real number.
19:13
So what that means is that C one and C two will then have to be complex numbers
19:24
that will cancel out so that you end up with a real number at the end of the day.
19:30
So you're working with a lot of complex numbers in order to model something that's real, which should feel kind of strange.
19:34
It does often happen in physics, especially when you're thinking about oscillatory things,
19:42
when you're doing waves, but it still should legitimately feel kind of strange.
19:46
So this is the general form we often call this the complex form of the solution because it's involving lots of complex numbers.
19:53
But we could also try to make this the real form of this expression.
20:05
So another thing that you learn here, at least in math one B and presumably in B.C. calculus is the Oilers formula.
20:08
So if you we we think about E to the city and we can express that as a point in the complex plane,
20:19
and it's telling us just about rotation by an angle of T from the positive x axis.
20:27
So you could then also express that as cosine in terms of cosine and sine so recall.
20:32
Euler's formula. Boilers.
20:39
Formula. So geometrically so we have a complex plane.
20:45
We make an angle of T from one, and this point can be thought of in two ways it is e to the I t, but it's also cosine t plus i sign T.
20:53
Which gives us this rather remarkable way of thinking about complex numbers to that when we think about multiplying by a complex number,
21:08
that it's representing rotation. So it's sort of a nice interpretation to have.
21:16
So if we use that in this form, we can plug in for E to the T here,
21:23
cosine t plus I signed T and we can plug in for here cosine negative tea and plus
21:28
I sign negative tea and then use our trig formulas to simplify those expressions.
21:38
And we can group things together to get an expression that only involves signs and co signs,
21:43
which hopefully also then feels more oscillatory than what we had before.
21:49
So now plugging in. To the complex form.
21:54
And we get the following, and we will spend more time driving this formula at the end of class using linear algebra.
22:06
So if it's not entirely clear how to see it yet? Don't worry.
22:15
So these will be different coefficients, a d one and D two, but now involving sine and cosine cosine de plus de to two.
22:20
So this is called the real form of your solutions. So these are different coefficients D1 and D2.
22:33
Again, I'll show how to go from this form to that form using linear algebra at the end.
22:39
But you can also see it by just plugging in with formula. So this is this is what I would tell my one B students to recall.
22:44
It's OK again, if you have not seen that before. It's just some context to think about.
22:55
And I think it's more of a place for food, for thought in terms of for your question, Jonathan.
23:00
I think a lot of the topics we think about towards the end of the semester are more
23:07
like to try to think about what comes next rather than necessarily just to focus on.
23:11
Exactly the details. OK, so we have this situation where remodeling a mass on a spring.
23:20
Let's think about it from another approach. So this is what could have come from my one big lesson.
23:33
Well, let's think about it from another point of view that's maybe more relevant to us.
23:41
So again, our starting point is just this differential equation,
23:47
so that can be totally entirely or context for this problem is it's just some differential equation you want to study.
23:50
So double prime plus acts of T is supposed to be equal to zero.
23:58
So you're saying you want some function x that satisfies this differential equations?
24:04
Well, another approach could be and this is actually a common approach, if you took a class like, Hey,
24:11
I'm one of five, a differential equations course is that you can introduce another variable here.
24:17
So I'm going to give a name to the first derivative of this function, which you might think of then, is the velocity.
24:24
So let's define V to be equal to x prime.
24:31
So I'm just naming the velocity. Well, now we could re express my differential equation here.
24:36
And a little bit of a different way. So I have V is equal to x prime.
24:47
So and then if I plug that into here and I express that in terms of V.
24:53
Well, this is then v prime plus x is equal to zero.
24:57
So I have then say the prime is equal to minus X and I have X prime is equal to V.
25:02
So instead of studying what we call a second order differential equation, it's called second order because it uses two derivatives.
25:10
It's also called constant coefficient.
25:18
These are the best kind of differential equations because they're nicely solvable, because all the coefficients are just constant numbers.
25:20
They're not functions, which makes things a little bit harder.
25:26
So here we've now turned this second order constant coefficient differential equation into two first order differential equations.
25:30
We now have a system of differential equations, which is sort of exciting for us because we've been working with systems of equations all semester,
25:38
so we can then transform this into a matrix equation. OK, so I'm going to express this idea as a matrix equation.
25:48
To then try to use linear algebra in order to understand what's going on.
25:59
So I'm going to write this as V and X, so I'm differentiating each of those two things.
26:04
So it's the derivative of that vector. Those are both functions of T.
26:09
Then on the other side of the equation. I want to multiply by some matrix.
26:14
Times the Vector X and V. So what Matrix could I put there to express the right hand side of these two equations?
26:22
Jonathan? What?
26:36
Negative ones have been we're not negative one. Here, so then I'm getting oh, I switched them, I'm going to change your answer, I'm sorry,
26:41
v and X, your answer was correct with what I'd written, but can now what I mean?
26:50
So thank you. There, I want to be consistent.
26:56
It's V and X and V and X over here. Otherwise, it's kind of a strange convention.
27:00
So the nice thing that's showing up now is that we're getting the form derivative is equal to matrix times your vector.
27:07
So this gives us a different way of expressing the exact same type of differential equation.
27:14
So now we could then take say we interpret this as like why the vector prime is equal to a the two by two matrix times vector.
27:20
Why? So now what we want to do is we want to solve differential equations of this form.
27:30
So you want to solve systems of First Order differential equations. So the goal?
27:37
To solve. Systems. First order equations.
27:46
Differential equations. So, namely, equations of the form vector, why prime is equal to matrix times Vector Y.
27:58
So we'll see two methods for solving differential equations of this form.
28:11
Many, many, many applications come down to solving applications, solving rather differential equations of this form systems of differential equations.
28:16
So if you're studying like environmental science, lots of your models will be coming up.
28:25
By thinking about like modeling pollution spread or modeling like flow, and they'll be going from one puddle to another,
28:30
where before you're thinking about biology, you want a model like an injection of something into your body.
28:37
You then have like different components representing different regions of your body.
28:42
There's like the bloodstream, there's the muscle inside the muscles and then the you measure the movement between those different regions.
28:46
And these kinds of models show up from these differential equations. So that's what we want to do.
28:54
We want to solve differential equations of this form. So what I want to do the way that I'm going to solve it,
29:03
and this is actually a common approach to solve many types of differential equations, not just the ones here is.
29:09
I'm going to go back to the way that we approached it in the first context.
29:16
So the way that we did it here is we tried to guess a solution of a nice form where we could then just figure out what it would be.
29:21
I'm going to try to guess a solution here, too. Why not?
29:29
It's just the derivative is equal to some constant, some matrix times the vector.
29:33
So it seems like it's kind of vaguely exponential.
29:38
Like, in fact, this is often the point of what's called the matrix exponential, and we can form an exponential matrix to solve this as well.
29:40
But so what we're going to do is we're going to try to guess a nice form for the solution.
29:51
So just like we did above, where I guess the form e to the T, I'm now going to guess the form that at some vector v times an exponential.
29:58
So let's guess that you have a solution of the form Y of T, so vector y is equal to some vector v times and exponential.
30:09
So where? V, I'm just going to make everything in our to some vector and two and lambda is some real number.
30:23
So this is a scalar and this is a vector. So just like I did before, if you're going to guess the form of a differential equation,
30:34
you would now plug it into your differential equation and see what conditions that gives you.
30:45
So I'm going to plug it into this thing and see what happens. So if I compute, why prime?
30:49
Of T. Well, that means I'm differentiating this thing. Well, we use a vector.
30:56
It's not a function. It doesn't depend on T at all. So it's just like a scalar.
31:01
So the only part that involves a T is right here. So this is then going to be equal to v times.
31:06
Lambda comes down e to the lambda T. So that's what the derivative of that particular gas is.
31:13
The other side of the equation is a times we are eight times y rather a times y of T,
31:23
so then that's just going to be equal to a times vector v times the scalar e to the lambda T.
31:30
So that means that I have a solution if and only if those two things are equal.
31:40
So let's think about what that means. So hence. Oops!
31:47
Pants. Why of T is equal to the E to the lamb, the T is a solution to the equation.
31:52
Y prime of T is equal to eight times y of T if and only if.
32:05
When I plug it in, so I would get lambda v e to the lambda T is equal to a times v e lambda t.
32:15
I need these two things to be equal. Yes, Tommy.
32:31
Well. Oh, no, no, no, Vector V is just some vector, it's constant, it's a constant, it's just some Vector V here.
32:37
I'm not saying that's like my velocity vector from before. That was a particular example for the example of the the, uh, the harmonic oscillator.
32:51
Yes. Sure. What is this, what is called an.
33:03
It's called what? Oh, yes, this is an onsite solution.
33:10
This is called an onslaughts. And. So in general, all of them are very exhausting.
33:14
So we can do this technique for reduction of order.
33:34
That's what we were doing here to introduce an auxiliary value variable to turn it into a system of first order equations.
33:37
There is a context in which we can do that. This won't always work.
33:45
Not all equations can be turned into this form. I mean, many equations might have your coefficients depending on time as well.
33:49
Like, for instance, a one way that you might be modeling a mass in a spring as like a car tire.
33:56
Right? You want to design the suspension system for a car? Well, I mean,
34:00
it's one way that you might try to mitigate the impact of the bouncing of the
34:04
car is to introduce a force to compensate for the the ground impacting the car,
34:07
so you can then try to cancel that out. So that would be then having some other thing coming in to balance it.
34:15
But here we can. So if you can turn your differential equation into this particular form, then we can form this gas of a solution of this form.
34:22
And we'd like to know what would have to be true for that to be a solution. Yeah.
34:31
James. That's a good question.
34:36
So because you might wonder, like, have we really found everything right?
34:43
Well, the thing that it sort of happens like in the same way when we talk about when we're working inside of a vector space,
34:49
like when we talk about finding a basis for a vector space, have we really found everything?
34:55
So you can take the span of the solutions you've found so far and then say, Well, how much of I found in the case of a linear differential equation,
34:59
one of this form the most number that you could find will correspond to the size of your matrix,
35:07
so you could find out most too linearly independent solutions here.
35:12
So once I've found to, I know to stop looking because it's a two by two matrix.
35:16
If it were an end by end matrix, then I would know there could be end linearly independent things, so I would look for any of them.
35:21
And that's that's specific to the situation where, because of the form of my differential equation,
35:27
if I take any linear combination of solutions, I get another solution. So then we're saying we're working with some subspace of solutions.
35:34
Senator, your question? Yes. There.
35:43
Here I am plugging in, right? I'm plugging this thing in.
35:58
So I just have a times that thing. Yep. So I'm just I'm I'm just doing what the Matrix tells me to do.
36:07
We plug it in and see what happens. So I need them to be equal. So that's what I have over here.
36:14
So now I can just move it over, say to the other side of the equation. So I have then zero is equal to a V,
36:19
and then I just have this scalar e to the lambda T. And I've moved this thing over to the other side of the equation.
36:27
So it becomes lambda b times e lambda T.
36:33
So remember e to the lambda T is just outputting a real number, so I can certainly just factor that out.
36:40
So then I have zero is equal to. A V minus lambda v.
36:46
Times E slammed a tweet. So now you want the product of these things to be equal to zero.
36:56
This is the zero vector, of course. So then this thing will never output zero.
37:04
So I know this thing has to be equal to zero. So then I have zero is equal to a V minus lambda v.
37:10
And then rearranging that equation then gives me a times v as equal to lambda times b.
37:19
So if I wanted this to be a solution.
37:32
What would you tell me about Lambda and V, what has to be true about these specific, the specific vector and the specific scalar?
37:38
Xavier. Yeah, I.
37:48
That's right. So then that means that we. Yes.
37:56
And again, Vector. And.
38:00
Lambda is an eigenvalue.
38:07
So if it's a two by two matrix, we know we can find out most too linearly independent eigenvectors, so we'll call them V-1 and V-2.
38:14
We have the corresponding eigenvalues lambda one and lambda two.
38:22
And then we can write down. Then the corresponding general solution to my differential equation y of T will be equal to see one.
38:25
Times v one e two. The Lambda one T plus c two v two times e the lambda two.
38:35
So just like I did before, any linear combination of these will also be a solution.
38:46
So I can describe the solution space by taking the span of those two solutions that I found because
38:51
I've now shown that each of those solutions corresponds to an eigen vector for that matrix.
38:58
I think this goes back to James question as well of how do we know that we found all of them?
39:03
Well, there can't be more than two linearly independent eigenvectors for two by two matrix.
39:07
Similarly, there can't be more than n linearly independent eigenvectors front end by end matrix.
39:12
Yeah, look. Mm-Hmm.
39:19
Well. How would we check that if we weren't convinced of it?
39:43
So like it's the case oftentimes where you're just not going to be sure of something like, I don't see why that's true.
39:51
How would you verify that it's true?
39:55
You just yeah, you just plug it in and verify that a linear combination of two solutions will give you another solution.
39:58
So like, you could compute the derivative twice and make sure that it does come out indeed to be negative of the original thing.
40:04
Tommy, you have. We can definitely have complex eigenvalues, yep.
40:12
I mean. Lambda, you're right, I should say lambda can be in C, too.
40:19
You're right, you're right. You're right, you're right. I'll make.
40:28
So they could be complex. Sure. Because, in fact, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, there will be complex.
40:35
We don't do very much in this class with complex eigenvalues. So I'm just trying to hint at what can happen.
40:41
Not we're not going to necessarily go through every last thing.
40:46
Yeah. What if is zero?
40:51
So certainly, you can't have your eigenvectors be equal to zero. What?
41:00
So we want B not to be zero, is what you're saying. So, yeah, we want a non-zero solution to this.
41:10
So because I mean, that's a fair point. So why do we what happens if B is equal to zero here?
41:16
What will happen? Well, if we go back to our differential equation, the derivative of zero is zero eight zero zero.
41:26
So sure, it's a solution. So it's sort of like saying whenever we look at a subspace, we always contain the zero vector.
41:34
So yes, we will have the zero solution to this thing. We're looking for the non-zero solutions.
41:41
So maybe non-zero. Savior.
41:48
In the wind, a combination of I was. If not, you will not necessarily also be.
42:04
But I'm not. Good question, I'm not asking for them to be an agent vector.
42:12
I'm just asking them for them to satisfy this relationship. So because the derivative here is going to be linear.
42:17
Operator Right. We know the derivative is a linear transformation.
42:24
If I take a linear combination of two things that satisfies this equation, the result will still satisfy the equation.
42:27
And again, to I think, Luke's question, we can literally plug in this expression for my general solution.
42:34
That's always a way to check if you have a solution to a differential equation, right?
42:42
Just like if you want to check whether you have an anti derivative, what do you do?
42:46
Well, you just differentiate it and see if it's what you wanted. Yes.
42:50
Do you mean the specific factors here? Read more.
43:11
Right. Yeah, we can think about that as a vector space.
43:22
So then you're taking an input function and you're out putting a function,
43:27
so then you're thinking about solving working on a particular function space.
43:30
You do often take that perspective and say quantum mechanics and physics when you're solving, when you have a differential operator in front of you.
43:39
That you need to solve. So then you're thinking about solving that on a particular function space so that
43:47
that context does come up and that what you do in that context as you compute a
43:53
bunch of eigenvalues and eigen functions eigenvectors and then you use that basis to
43:57
solve the differential equation in that context with respect to that nice basis. Yeah.
44:01
This does work for constant coefficient differential equations of higher order using kind of a
44:12
similar trick to the one I did there to turn it into a system of First Order differential equations.
44:17
So that kind of a technique does come up a lot. I'll point out,
44:21
there are a lot of different ways you would approach studying differential
44:26
equations depending on the type of differential equation you have in front of you.
44:29
Sort of the nicest ones you often encounter and the ones we work with the most in engineering and physics are the constant coefficient ones.
44:32
And the reason for that is mostly because they're nice to solve.
44:39
It's not necessarily because, like they encapsulate like the full difficulty of the problem we might be studying.
44:43
So they make them sort of a nice approximation. I mean, this comes up throughout the engineering and physics literature.
44:49
When you want to then study something, you're like, Well, turn it into a simple, simple harmonic oscillator and model it that way.
44:56
But you might want a more sophisticated differential equation.
45:05
The problem then becomes like it might be hard to solve when you have a situation like that,
45:08
like we have difficult differential equations, you often then use numerical methods to solve those differential equations.
45:13
So use a computer simulations. OK, so that's a little bit of a theory.
45:21
Let's do an example. Well, the race.
45:28
Race the earlier stuff. So again, in terms of a linear algebra problem,
45:36
you can just take this to be your starting point is you want to find why such that y prime is equal to eight times y,
45:55
so you want to find a solution to this differential equation. So let's consider a particular example.
46:04
Let's take. The following differential equation.
46:10
So let's take why Prime is equal to one to three to four times, why do you?
46:17
So your derivatives will be this kind of linear combination of your.
46:30
Function. And I'd like to know what functions do that.
46:37
Well, our strategy now is you find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of your associated matrix.
46:43
So here we have a two by two matrix so we can find the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
46:49
So the eigenvalues. Well, then you compute the zeros of the characteristic polynomial.
46:55
So the characteristic polynomial in this case comes out to be lambda minus four times lambda plus one.
47:02
So the two eigenvalues will be four and minus one.
47:13
They're distinct. So you already know what's going to be diagonal sizable.
47:18
Because you can just take an eigenvectors corresponding to four and eigenvectors
47:23
corresponding to minus one and then find Um and then take the use that I analyzation theory.
47:27
So we know how to compute eigen spaces so we can compute the EIGEN space corresponding to four.
47:36
This comes out to be the span of the vector two three.
47:42
And we know how to compute the iron space corresponding to the eigenvalue of negative one.
47:48
This corresponds to negative one one. So then what the previous observation tells us is that the general solution to the system
47:54
should then be why T is equal to some constant C one times this first basis factor to three.
48:07
Eat the 40 plus see two times E to the minus 80 percent in my back door minus one one.
48:21
So any solution to this particular differential equation will be of this form.
48:33
So we can then write down all of them, C one and C two might be coming from some initial measurements that you've made for your system,
48:39
like maybe, you know, the initial position or the initial velocity of what you're studying.
48:48
So then you can use to that to solve for C one and C two. So if you think about what this does, though, like for a fixed C one and C two,
48:53
this will trace out some region in the plane ride, some outputting for each time a vector and R two.
49:05
So it's giving you some kind of a solution trajectory inside of the plane so we can think
49:12
about a geometric perspective on this by plotting those points for a geometric perspective.
49:18
This is to connect back to say one B, for instance, this is called the phase portrait.
49:27
So what we're going to do is we're just going to plot some of these for particular values of C one and C two.
49:38
So let's do that. So, you know what, I want to move to a different board.
49:47
One of them, well, I guess I can do what I could do some work over here. I'll do this work over here.
49:55
So let's let's start kind of slowly here.
50:02
So let's take some simple values of C one and C two.
50:09
So suppose I take C one is equal to, I don't know, one and C two is equal to zero, then the corresponding solution y of T.
50:13
Well, it'll be two three times e to the 14.
50:27
So if I plotted that in the plane, what would that look like?
50:35
So I applaud that for different values of tea. So in T equals zero, it's the point to three.
50:41
All right, so I go over a one to one to three, so it's up here.
50:48
It's right there, if I plug in T is equal to two.
50:54
What will that point look like? For plug in T is equal to three.
50:59
He's equal to for what's going to happen when you plot all these points.
51:07
Several people are just. Which is a correct gesture.
51:13
So it's just this vector two three scale by something the T value is scaling by larger and larger real numbers,
51:19
so it's going to continue in that direction and just keep going. So it's going to be in the eigen space corresponding to the eigenvalue of four.
51:26
And it will just march off to infinity. So in this case.
51:34
We have the eigen space here,
51:40
here is the eigen space corresponding the eigenvalue for this particular solution then goes outwards as T goes to infinity.
51:43
Well, you could think about what about if I took say, sea was equal to negative one?
51:57
What would happen that? So what if I took C one with a negative one C to is equal to zero?
52:02
Well, then I have a solution y of T is equal to negative two three d to the forty.
52:10
What happens here? So again, I see some people answering with gestures.
52:20
Now it's going the opposite way, but still in that same island space.
52:27
So it's not going this way. So in one case, you're going off to infinity along the eigen space for two and sort of the first quadrant.
52:32
The other case, you're going down. So all I'm doing here is I'm plugging in different values of tea and I'm plotting the outputs.
52:44
So it gives me these trajectories in the face space. OK, well, now let's think about what would happen if instead I made sea one equal to zero.
52:52
And I looked at coefficients of sea to. So where should I do that?
53:03
We're here. Should use a different color.
53:11
So now I'm going to take C one is you can you see this color?
53:23
No, that's not. Use it then. I can barely see it right in front of my face.
53:28
How about that you could see this one, right? It's an awkward angle for you, Jonathan, can you still see it?
53:38
Yeah, you can. That said, the name for the past and for the past, how long?
53:43
Trying to write a. Hmm.
53:52
I'm not sure what to do with that. I could go back 15 minutes.
54:02
Well. So.
55:05
I think the shortest summary I can give of what we've been doing is that we want to find some functions that satisfy some properties.
55:17
If you go back to the simplest thing that you've done back in calc one, when you've learned about exponential functions,
55:27
you're looking for functions that, when you differentiate them, are equal to k times the original function.
55:34
So then you know that you're looking for functions of the form. E is your function is equal to C e to the Katie, for instance.
55:39
And that's the first situation where you think about differential equations.
55:48
You might also think about the differential equations when you think about like you have a constant rate of change.
55:52
So then you know, you're modeling a linear function in calc one, your solution will be of the form Y equals m x plus b.
55:57
All we're doing here is we're doing the same thing for linear functions of in variables.
56:05
So when we think about what's going on here, I'm saying why prime,
56:14
the derivative of some vector of functions will be equal to a matrix times your original vector.
56:18
So you should contrast that, I mean, when you're trying to make sense of a new mathematical context and you think about a new application,
56:25
think about the simplest instance of this you can. The simplest instance of this question would be a one by one matrix.
56:32
So if you go back to a one by one matrix,
56:39
then you have one component function why you have one component function here and you have a one by one matrix.
56:42
So you have the situation. Why prime of T is equal to this one by one matrix K and Y of T.
56:50
So you want some function that when I differentiate, it is just k times the original function.
56:59
So we know a function that does that from the differentiation rules we learned in calc one to say that this will be why of T.
57:05
Well, that's equal to E to the Katich. Right.
57:13
But there are more of those. There's not just this one. You could take like an initial amount of stuff,
57:18
like the initial amount of money in your bank account to the initial number of cells if you're modeling exponential population growth or something.
57:24
So you get then to here. So right there, you're taking a linear combination of a single vector.
57:31
And because it's a one by one matrix, there was only one function that you needed to look for that would satisfy this condition.
57:38
When we start going to larger matrices, all we're doing is we're considering then systems of differential equations where I'm taking now.
57:46
I have one function where when I differentiate, it is k times some other function.
57:54
Then I have another function that's equal to something. Times the derivatives of those original functions.
57:59
So you have more conditions that are coming up. The simplest instance I can tell you where this comes up is where you just take an oscillator,
58:04
where you're just going back and forth a mass on a spring already right there.
58:14
We are led to a system of two linear equations.
58:19
So. There are many other instances where you might study differential equations of this form, so you might want techniques for solving them.
58:24
The main technique we have for solving them is to then look for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of your associated matrix.
58:34
The reason for that is because it turns your differential equation into one where you can solve it more simply.
58:42
OK. So there are two perspectives that you can kind of take on this problem.
58:49
One is this kind of geometric perspective that I'm trying to describe where we look at a general solution.
58:53
And you say, Well, what do these general solutions look like?
58:59
Well, for any T along this line, for any function along this line, your populations will or your quantities will go off to infinity.
59:02
That's interesting to know from a qualitative perspective,
59:12
if you're studying like pollution spread and you know that under the current model, things are just going to keep blowing up.
59:16
That might be something you might want to intervene in if, on the other hand,
59:21
things were collapsing down to zero and that's modeling your population, that could also be bad.
59:25
So you want to think about like,
59:30
what are you representing in this qualitative behavior might give you an idea of what you want to do with that information.
59:32
So here what we want to do is from these solutions we're getting, we want to know how do they work?
59:39
When you take one of those particular solutions, like you do some experiment, you go to the pond,
59:46
you measure this many fish in the pond and that allows you to solve for a
59:50
specific constancy one here and a specific constancy to from the experiments,
59:54
from the measurements you've done. Now that's going to determine some kind of a behavior as time goes on.
1:00:00
Is it going to spiral around and just kind of was it going to just go in a circle?
1:00:07
Is it going to oscillate? I mean, if you're modeling mosquitoes, I mean, when we do this in one B, we often do the example of spraying for mosquitoes.
1:00:11
If you spray for mosquitoes in the wrong portion of their cycle of the population growth cycle,
1:00:20
you can actually lead to a larger increase in the number of population of the mosquitoes.
1:00:25
So the intervention that you do actually really matters in the timing of when you do it.
1:00:30
So you want to have an understanding of what these solution trajectories look like in order to know when you might intervene.
1:00:35
So here I want to know what these this solution looks like.
1:00:43
I don't. In this context, it's not representing anything in particular other than a bunch of points in the plan.
1:00:49
So I want to know what happens as T goes to infinity. Well, that's going to depend on what C one and C two are.
1:00:55
So the next case we need to understand is if C one is equal to zero.
1:01:01
So you don't have this part and you only have this part. Well, then that means it's going to be a vector.
1:01:05
So C two and e to the minus T, all those do is scale a particular vector.
1:01:10
So every output will then be along the line determined by the span of negative one one.
1:01:16
So if I draw this vector negative one one, this is my eigen space corresponding to the eigenvalue of negative one.
1:01:22
Now you want to know what happens as T gets larger in this case, because it's e to the minus T,
1:01:31
I'm then going to be going towards the origin, so I'll be moving this way along this IGen space towards the origin.
1:01:37
So that also tells you something interesting.
1:01:46
If you happen to be near zero and maybe you perturb the solution a little bit, you might wonder what will happen.
1:01:48
Well, if I happen to perturb it in the direction of the minus one I space, I just get pushed back to zero.
1:01:56
If I pushed it a little bit in the direction of the E four again space, then I get pulled off to infinity.
1:02:03
So at this point where the behavior is fundamentally different in two different directions, we then call a saddle point.
1:02:10
It's like you're at a mountain pass or something and you want to know which direction will the ball rolling.
1:02:17
We'll be perfectly push it up the sides of the mountain pass. It might come back to that point.
1:02:22
But if you had any component down the other side of the mountain pass, it will just fall off.
1:02:27
So now you might wonder, well, what if you had C one and C two, they're both non-zero?
1:02:34
Well, how does the growth of E to the four T compare to eat the minus T?
1:02:41
How do these functions compare? How do they compare?
1:02:48
Matthew? It grows at a much faster rate.
1:03:00
Right, so if T gets really large, this thing is basically zero and this thing is the only one that's dominating.
1:03:04
So then it gets really large that tells you that you're going to be parallel to the E for IGen space.
1:03:11
So when you have your solutions coming out, if you were on this IGen space and you perturbed your solution a little bit off,
1:03:17
well, then that means you get pulled towards this IGen space E4 because that eigenvalue was bigger.
1:03:24
Similarly, over here, I would get pulled towards the E eigen space if I got perturbed off this line a little
1:03:30
bit like I added some mosquitoes or something and I get pushed this direction.
1:03:36
If I got pushed down, then I get pushed to be parallel to the E for eigen space.
1:03:41
And that's coming from these exponents just from our knowledge of pre-calculus.
1:03:47
How do exponential functions grow? This grows much more quickly than this one does.
1:03:52
So your funked your outputs are going to be then parallel to this space where essentially parallel because this one gets very small.
1:03:57
So this picture gives us an idea of what's going to happen for the entire system, for wherever we are.
1:04:05
We know, roughly speaking, what's going to happen. Depending on what your eigenvalues are, you can get different behavior.
1:04:11
So, for instance, if both of my eigenvalues were, then so in this case, I have one that's negative and one that's positive.
1:04:22
What do you think would happen if they were both positive?
1:04:29
Then we're probably going to we're going to be pushed away from the origin in both directions.
1:04:33
And in this case, you would call in both directions are going to be pushed away like E for so be going pushed away because the exponents are positive.
1:04:37
And so then in that case, you would call the origin, then you would call it a source or a repeller.
1:04:47
Everything is pushed away from the origin. You make a small change to your system.
1:04:52
You get pushed off to infinity in any direction. If you had two negative eigenvalues, what do you think would happen?
1:04:57
Our shooter. It's a sink, it's a sink or in a tractor, everything gets pushed towards the origin.
1:05:06
And again, the way that they get pushed towards the origin is exactly according to the magnitudes of those eigenvalues and the direction eigen spaces.
1:05:12
So there are a few different ways that you can think about that when you think about what I can fit in this last.
1:05:22
Six minutes. What will be the most beneficial for you?
1:05:30
I'm my mom. I guess I want to emphasize more the linear algebra.
1:05:35
There are some other examples here, and certainly for some of you, depending on what courses you want to take next.
1:05:42
There, you probably want to know a little bit more about the differential equations.
1:05:49
It's also a great beginning point for a project idea to go further in this direction.
1:05:54
Instead of this particular approach, what I'd like to do is to connect this back to not the geometric view, but this view of diagnosing.
1:06:01
So let's try that for the last few minutes. So another perspective.
1:06:13
If you are very interested in differential equations for maybe what the coursework you need to do next.
1:06:29
There's certainly plenty you could do for a final project, but we'll also recommend the course and 105,
1:06:35
which is a differential equations course in the applied math department for the math department.
1:06:40
If you're interested in differential equations in support of physics, math one 10 is sort of the canonical course to take.
1:06:44
Which picks up with some of these ideas. So if we have this picture.
1:06:52
Uh. The differential equation y prime is equal to a times y.
1:07:00
Well, recall, the whole point of what we've been doing was the diagonals so we could try to diagonals at.
1:07:09
So if a is diagonal sizable.
1:07:17
Going wise of all. Then. A is equal to P D P Inverse by the dog analyzation theorem.
1:07:25
So the diagnostician theorem tells us this when the case where p is your event,
1:07:36
you're a matrix of eigenvectors, you one through the end and D is your diagonal matrix with your eigenvalues.
1:07:40
So we have that situation. And let's, in fact, specialized to end as equal to two, because we've mostly been working with two by two matrices anyway.
1:07:54
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to change coordinates. I'm going to work in the basis of eigenvectors.
1:08:03
So instead of working with why I'm going to work with X, so X will then be p inverse times y.
1:08:08
So remember that change is coordinates from Y, the standard coordinates to the basis of eigenvectors.
1:08:16
OK, well now we'd like to know what your what is your differential equation look like in this new coordinate system?
1:08:24
Well, if I take y prime, it's supposed to be equal to eight times y and I just plug in well, here y is then equal to P times X.
1:08:31
So we're just changing coordinates p times x prime will then be equal to a times b times x.
1:08:41
So if I differentiate P times X, it's just a p is just a matrix with no variables in it.
1:08:52
So it's just p times x prime. So A times, B, times X.
1:08:58
Well, A. Is equal to P D, P Inverse, because it's diagnosable.
1:09:05
Times X, times x. So the one thing we see is that the P, the P here and the P inverse, they cancel out.
1:09:13
So I then have p times X is equal to p d times x.
1:09:23
Now I have a pee here and a pea here, so I can multiply in the left by inverse.
1:09:32
And this then gives me ex prime. Ex prime is equal to D times X.
1:09:37
And let's just do that really quickly. My last two minutes for a two by two matrix.
1:09:45
So that's saying we have a situation x one prime x two prime is equal to this diagonal matrix lambda one zero zero lambda two times x one x two.
1:09:52
So if I multiply this out, I then get X one time X to prime is then equal to lambda one x one lambda two x two.
1:10:10
So I get a system of two equations. So I got X one prime is equal to lambda one x one lambda, two prime is equal to lambda two x two.
1:10:21
These two equations are really nice because this equation doesn't involve the other one at all.
1:10:34
It's a totally a calc one problem. Now you're just looking for some function of one variable that when you differentiate,
1:10:39
it is equal to lambda one times the original function so that you can tell, I can tell you exactly will be X.
1:10:45
One of T is equal to see one. E to the lambda, one t same thing here.
1:10:52
This is then X two of T is equal to C to Tanzi Lambda two T.
1:11:00
So in this coordinate system, when we change to a basis of eigenvectors, it was to calc one problems to solve.
1:11:08
It wasn't this complicated system of differential equations to solve.
1:11:15
So then working in that diagonal coordinate system in the eigen basis, it made our system of differential equations much easier to study.
1:11:20
So that's sort of the point of doing this is that when we change into this nicer coordinate system,
1:11:30
we get a system of differential equations that don't involve any of the other variables and then are much easier to solve.
1:11:35
So then when you want to know solutions back in the usual coordinate system, you just change coordinates back to get your answer.
1:11:41
And you would get the exact same answer as before.
1:11:47
So what I wanted to do today is just to give you a brief taste of what some applications to differential equations would look like.
1:11:51
There are certainly many more directions you could take.
1:12:01
We didn't get to do a systematic analysis of what all the different eigenvalues could tell you.
1:12:04
You might also wonder what a geometric perspective in our three would look like.
1:12:09
And now, instead of having the phase portrait in the plane,
1:12:13
you have the face portrait in space and you've got your curves spiraling around and it can be much more interesting.
1:12:16
This comes up a lot when you're doing sort of biological modeling as well, you're modeling the heart,
1:12:23
beating very quickly or modeling people breathing in and out or neurons firing in the brain.
1:12:28
You get these sorts of systems of differential equations showing up quite a lot.
1:12:32
And you use linear methods to solve them as much as possible. All right.
1:12:36
I apologize for going one minute over. I'll see all of you, hopefully on Friday.
