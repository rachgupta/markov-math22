Why don't we go ahead and get started? So welcome.
0:01
It's our last class today, so it's a little a little sad, but we have a lot in front of us too to look forward to.
0:07
So. In terms of the projects, I'm getting excited to read the drafts, so hopefully you've already turned in your draft, if you haven't yet, that's OK.
0:21
But make sure that you turn it in very soon. I think I've changed the peer reviews to now go out this evening.
0:32
Yes. If you click on the canvas page under assignments, there should be an item there.
0:40
Project Draft And then I think there there's like probably submit or upload or something like that.
0:54
If you can't find it, I'll help you find it after you have found it.
1:04
OK, great. So in terms of then what's coming?
1:07
So I think there's now you'll get assigned to projects to review tonight.
1:12
I think ideally about 9:00 p.m. It'll Emilio links to read them again.
1:18
I don't think this will take an amazing amount of time,
1:24
but I think it'll be really instructive and seeing what other people do and how that might impact what your project looks like.
1:27
So keep that in mind. Then over the next five days or so.
1:32
So you should either get written comments back on your draft from your t.f reader or you should get comments from in person from your t.f reader.
1:42
So for instance, I plan on reaching out to my students to schedule a meeting either tomorrow, Friday or Monday or Tuesday.
1:54
But by the end of day on Tuesday, you should have heard back. Certainly, if you haven't, you should feel free to reach out to your TRF reader or me.
2:06
If you're not sure entirely who that is, hopefully you should know who that is by this point.
2:14
And then the final version of your project will be due on Monday, December 13th.
2:20
By the end of day five p.m. OK, so that's what I need to have the final version to degrade.
2:26
Are there any questions about what to expect there? Yes, Tommy, all.
2:34
Just one step it'll submit for the whole group. Other questions.
2:42
If you don't get an email from canvas, giving you access to some four peer reviews say within twenty four hours,
2:51
you can feel free to email me, and that might mean that there's some kind of a bug that I need to track down and fix.
3:00
So feel free. Other questions.
3:06
So there are a few things that I need to do today.
3:12
One of the ways that I'm going to end today's class is to talk about what happens aftermath 20 to a I need to
3:18
tell you at least one wrinkle about math 20 to be so the the wrinkle is that my wife is currently pregnant,
3:26
which I am very. Yeah.
3:36
Thank you. We're we're very excited about that. It'll be number three.
3:45
So a third mathematician? Maybe the third can be a physicist, I don't know.
3:50
So but what that does mean is that it makes the spring semester a little bit more complicated.
3:58
So what my plan was is that I was going to take a bit of a leave and the spring semester.
4:02
And so we currently had had someone lined up that I would share 20 to be with while I was on leave.
4:09
But unfortunately, that arrangement has fallen through. So there is some probability that there might be a change in instructor for 20 to be.
4:17
That's not known yet. So I just wanted to make sure that you're all sort of aware that it might be someone else teaching Math 20 to be instead of me.
4:25
It'll still be a great class and maybe even a better class. But but I will talk about today how they're still.
4:35
I want you to know what options are available to you and what courses that you should consider for next semester.
4:48
But I one didn't want that to be a surprise coming out of Out of the Blue.
4:55
So in terms of mathematical content, we have one bit of math that I wanted to finish up today that I think is just a really beautiful theorem.
5:00
And then there are nice follow ups of this that you're going to see in actually quite a lot of the projects.
5:09
So the main application of the spectral theorem or one main application,
5:16
there are a number of different ways you could go towards giving singular value decomposition of a matrix and the applications of that.
5:20
I was hoping today would be that, but we've gotten a little bit behind schedule.
5:28
So instead will prove the spectral theorem that will make a nice capstone for the semester and then my rest of the class.
5:32
I want to talk about post math 20 to a.
5:39
So we have this theorem that is orthogonal diagonals of all, if and only if a is symmetric.
5:45
So last time we prove the forward direction that if we knew that it was orthogonal diagonal sizable, then.
5:54
It would be a symmetric matrix. So what we're left to do is to prove this reverse direction.
6:06
And I think it's a really nice sort of tour of a lot of the ideas that we've seen.
6:11
So we started setting this up last time. So we suppose we have we are going to prove this by contradiction.
6:15
So suppose not.
6:21
So namely, that we say that we can have a symmetric matrix, and we're supposing the conclusion then doesn't work, so it's not orthogonal, diagnosable.
6:25
And we're going to assume that we have the smallest KN where this happens.
6:39
OK. So namely, suppose a v a symmetric.
6:43
And by RN Matrix, that is not.
6:56
Not orthogonal, diagonally visible. And if there is such a matrix like this, there's a smallest one where an is as small as possible.
7:04
So we noted last time that and has to be bigger than one.
7:25
Because a one by one matrix is sort of trivially diagnosable. So we'd like to then think about what we could do with this.
7:32
So we have a lot of results from last class.
7:40
If we have a symmetric matrix, we know that we have real eigenvalue say.
7:46
So let's take one of those real eigenvalues. So our goal is going to be we're going to give an orthogonal diagonal ization for this matrix.
7:51
OK, so we're going to contradict that. It's not orthogonal. Diagnosable. OK.
8:01
So by our previous theorem from last time. Phi Theorem from last class.
8:08
We know a has all real eigenvalues. So let's name one and take particular Vector.
8:21
So let's take Lambda one to be one again, vector eigenvalue eigenvalue with corresponding unit eigen vector.
8:36
You want. So namely, that means, of course, that a times you one is equal to lambda, one times you want and it's a unit vector, its length one.
8:53
So we're given already that we know we can do that.
9:04
So what I'd like to do is then find the other and minus one vectors that I would need to do that.
9:10
To Dove analyze the whole thing.
9:17
I want them to be orthogonal, though, so I'm going to consider them the set of vectors that are orthogonal to this given vector.
9:19
So let's take now to set W to just be the set of vectors in our NW W such that W dotted with oh right,
9:27
this way you one dotted with W is equal to zero.
9:40
So we have this vector you in space with this vector, you in space,
9:48
and we're taking that everything perpendicular to that the orthogonal complement of that given vector.
9:53
So you can then think about what this is, is that this is the orthogonal complement of the span of you one.
9:58
So. A nice note in the front row here.
10:16
Takes a little of a couple of how many trends positions that are.
10:23
It's a nice idea. What does the one hundred and eight mean?
10:31
Nothing. OK. But got.
10:41
Oh, I see, OK. I say, OK, OK.
10:47
But they're vectors, so it's like a bunch of actors. One number of.
10:52
So one thing that we can think about this is we can then think about this is then the null space of U.
11:02
One transpose. So what dimension will W have?
11:07
It's actually relevant to many of the projects I've wasted that I've met with people what Dimension W have.
11:19
It will be on minus one. We know that you has a non-zero vector.
11:32
So then if we're taking everything orthogonal to that, we then get something that where the dimension of W is equal to and minus one.
11:36
So the orthogonal compliment is then and minus one dimensional. OK.
11:47
It's a subspace, so I can certainly take an author's normal basis for the subspace.
11:53
We can apply. We can give a basis and then apply. Graham Schmidt to then get on with the normal basis if we want.
11:59
So I'm going to then take the basis you two through UN to the north of normal basis.
12:05
For W. So there and minus one vectors there.
12:17
Just sort of indexed it in a funny way because I've already defined a you one.
12:21
All right. So what I'd like to know is what a does two things inside of W.
12:28
So let's just think about that for a moment. So note or side note, if you take an element, say you inside of W or sorry w inside of W.
12:36
Then if I play to that element, it's going to stay in this particular subspace.
12:51
And A.W. is an element in W.
12:57
So that means that we can think about this Matrix A as a function on W, as a function from W to W, so let's maybe I'll prove that.
13:06
So this is because how would we check that A.W. is inside of W?
13:17
How would you check that? Are you?
13:21
Perfect, right, so we just need to check this orthogonal city condition, so we want to take you one dotted with a W.
13:27
So we're computing this particular dot product, so this is then by definition,
13:38
you one transpose times a W. Well, then I can move the say a inside the transpose by taking its transpose.
13:42
It's a symmetric matrix. So then this would be equal to a U.
13:53
One Transpose times w. Then eight times you won, you won was chosen to be an eigenvectors.
13:58
So this becomes lambda one you won.
14:08
Transpose Times W, which is then just lambda, one times you one dotted with W.
14:11
We're now u one w was an element in W.
14:18
So then this dot product will be equal to zero. So we definitely do stay inside that particular subspace.
14:22
All right. So now this is where I think it gets kind of fun.
14:31
Let me just take off my jacket. This is where I think it gets kind of fun because what we now have is we have here W.
14:45
And then we have a as a function from W to W.
15:00
So now W is an RN minus one dimensional subspace and of our RN.
15:07
How do we often study things? Study vector spaces. Thinking back to Chapter four,
15:11
how do you what approach do you often use to study if you have a function from one vector space or one subspace to another subspace?
15:18
Right, so we kind of we do a change of basis or we put coordinates on our vector space.
15:30
So here we have an end minus one dimensional subspace, so we could use the coordinate mapping coming from this particular basis up here.
15:36
So maybe I'll name that basis. So let's take a.
15:45
B to b u two, three u n.
15:52
So then that gives me a coordinate mapping down to what copy of our will be here.
15:58
R n minus one, because it's n minus one dimensional.
16:06
And this is then the coordinate mapping where I put things in coordinates relative to the EU coordinates and I do the same thing on the code domain.
16:09
So the usual thing that we do then is we study the associated matrix the matrix down here.
16:20
So I'm going to give a name to this matrix. And I call this thing am.
16:26
But I'd want to think about what those vertical arrows are doing, those changes of coordinates because it's a little bit subtle.
16:34
So let's take an element in W. So let's kind of this is a little bit long winded for a proof,
16:41
but nevertheless, I think it's kind of a nice discussion and tying our ideas together.
16:48
Let's take an element in W. Well,
16:52
the whole point of having a basis and how you compute the coordinates relative to a particular basis is you express X then as a linear combination.
16:58
So then X is equal to say C to you two plus da da da C and you n four unique scalar c two, three and four unique.
17:08
Sailors. See to see, yeah, that's because it's a basis.
17:26
And then by the way, we defined the coordinate mapping relative to this basis was that this was the tuple of those weights.
17:34
See two down to see RN giving me a vector in R and minus one.
17:44
So that's how we get what the coordinate mapping is going down there.
17:55
But so this is a vector equation. How else could we express this vector equation?
18:00
So if we have. X is equal to see to you two.
18:05
Plus da da da see and you kn going back almost to the beginning of the semester.
18:11
How else do we think about that vector equation? Her, sure.
18:18
Right, so what do you usually think of this is then the matrix you two or you end times the vector, see two down, three see in.
18:28
So usually we call this matrix, then the change of coordinates matrix, we'll call this matrix, then say P.
18:39
And then this is expert and relative to the court.
18:50
So then X, so just to summarize, we have X is equal to P times X written relative to the B coordinates.
18:55
Now, can I compute P Inverse? Can I compute Inverse?
19:06
It's not square, so we can't compute inverse,
19:13
we have to be a little bit careful here because these vectors W and everything and W lives inside of our end, right?
19:16
It's an RN minus one dimensional thing inside of our end.
19:23
But. I want to move. Get rid of this pea.
19:29
What could I multiply by to get rid of it? What could I do?
19:32
James P. transpose, because we haven't or the normal basis.
19:38
So these are then orthogonal vectors, so they are of length one.
19:43
So then that means that p transpose times X is equal to p transpose P, which is equal to the identity matrix.
19:50
So that is x written relative to the B quartz.
19:59
So if you wanted to take a particular Vector X written relative to the standard coordinates and turn it into X written relative to the B coordinates,
20:04
you can multiply by P transpose, which is what these down arrows should be doing.
20:12
So this is multiplying by p transpose and this is multiplying by p transpose.
20:18
So then that tells us what we could now give a formula for air.
20:25
So let's now give a formula for what is by just following our way around the diagram.
20:31
So our clever thing that we're doing here is we're actually putting coordinates on our hyper plane on our end minus one subspace of our RN.
20:39
And then in those coordinates, it will then be and regarded as something in orange minus one.
20:47
So if you think about then what is so hence?
20:56
Well, what is it?
21:04
You can regard it as just going along the red arrow or instead you could go up, which would be then multiplying by pea to go up instead of transpose.
21:05
Then you go across by a and then you go down. So you first.
21:15
Yes, Jonathan. So that. He.
21:20
The. If it were square, this thing isn't square, though.
21:25
What we did right here, so we multiply both sides of this equation by transpose,
21:36
this literally will give us let me maybe write it over here, p transpose.
21:41
Can you actually see this?
21:46
OK, p transpose x is equal to p transpose p times x written relative to the B coordinate system, so we proved for an author a normal basis.
21:48
So if your matrix has all the normal columns, then we prove p transpose P will be equal to the identity matrix.
22:01
That's something we proved. So then what M is, is that when you first go up IP, then you apply a and then you go down by P transpose.
22:06
Again, the thing to keep in mind here is that P isn't square matrix here,
22:24
and the reason for that is because P is taking something in r n minus one and then embedding it into R rn.
22:28
So it's going to have an end minus one columns, each living inside of our end.
22:39
All right. But now, yeah. Is and b p going from R B to our standard bases, yes, p is p transpose, then goes the other way.
22:50
W. has a basis, B that we're using to get the coordinates down here.
23:12
Right. So then here W is everything's written in terms of standard coordinates up here,
23:18
and then we're using the particular basis to get a new the coordinates down here.
23:22
Yep. So what do you notice about this matrix, though?
23:27
What what can you tell me about what properties does it have?
23:33
Marco. This is a little bit like those of the divers going backwards because they were following him.
23:36
You would go up his first feet to go up his pee.
23:43
Yeah. Because he has right to left. Matthew?
23:49
And we'll be square, yes, what size will M have? What me and minus one by minus one, so that's already a good note.
23:58
So this is an RN minus one by and minus one matrix.
24:07
What else can you tell me about it? What do you notice about him transpose?
24:13
It's equal to em, so it's symmetric, so this is an end minus one by and minus one symmetric matrix.
24:26
Why does that seem like it might be helpful? The camera.
24:32
That will definitely be helpful. Is there anything else that might be helpful before that moment?
24:47
What do we assume about a. We assumed a was not diagnosable.
24:54
That's right, Daniel. Perfect.
25:01
Exactly, we assumed a was the smallest size, and you could have where your matrix would not be orthogonal, diagonally visible.
25:17
Now we've constructed a symmetric matrix that's minus one by n minus one.
25:26
So then our assumption tells us that this thing must be orthogonal, diagonally visible.
25:31
Otherwise, the whole thing wouldn't have made sense at the beginning. So then that means that M is orthogonal a visible by our initial assumption.
25:36
Yes, Tommy. Compute m transpose.
25:52
So if I compute, I'm trimmed and transpose I'm picking the transpose of these three factors and
25:59
then I reverse the order of those and you get the same thing because asymmetric. Other questions.
26:04
All right. So AM is with organic diagonals. Yes, Jonathan.
26:14
Because we assumed a was the smallest size and you could have where there exists a symmetric matrix that's not orthogonal, diagnosable.
26:21
So then this one would be an end minus one by and minus one symmetric matrix.
26:31
So then it must be orthogonal, diagnosable.
26:35
So that means we can find a basis that will orthogonal die, analyze it, so then we let's give a name to that basis.
26:39
So I'm going to give a name to the basis that does that. So I'm going to use it to find the basis in terms of the coordinates on basis B.
26:49
I'm going to let X two relative to be up through X.
26:57
And so these and minus one vectors written relative to the B coordinates will be the basis that's going to orthogonal diagonals.
27:04
So this will be an or the normal.
27:14
Basis the diagonals analyzes an.
27:20
So that's the thing that does it.
27:33
OK, so down here, we know there's some basis for our N minus one or some collection of N minus one vectors down here that will diagonals em.
27:37
And we can make them more than normal. Because it diagonals is M.
27:47
That means each of them must be an eigen vector.
27:54
So since we have an eigen basis, that idealization theorem then tells us that they're going to be eigenvectors.
27:59
We have an eigen or we have a diagonal sizing basis.
28:08
And I can basis, I'll read it that way. Then that means that m times each of these vectors.
28:15
Will be equal to some scalar, which I'll call you. For.
28:25
Each K from two through, and so this is just noting that they are eigenvectors.
28:34
OK. They diagonals, they have to be eigenvectors. All right.
28:46
So now think about what the goal was. I mean, we've done a bit of work now, let's think about what we're trying to do.
29:01
We're trying to find a basis for our end that forms an author normal and all the normal basis for our RN that consists of eigenvectors for a.
29:07
Well, we have you won as a nice factor already in our end.
29:20
A nice eigenvectors for a. How could I complete that, what vectors might you take in our RN to try to give then and all the normal eigenvectors basis?
29:25
What would you add to you, one, given the work we've done here? What might we add to you want to complete the story?
29:37
Let's remember, we don't want to add the U.S. You to the U.N. because they weren't eigenvectors.
29:56
They were definitely worth a normal. So that was good, but they weren't eigenvectors.
30:02
So we did a bunch of work to modify them to then find some eigenvectors.
30:07
So what would be the thing to take to get eigenvectors? What factors should we take?
30:12
See, Daniel. Yeah, so if we take these new vectors X to through X N,
30:24
they're going to live up here inside of W because they're before applying the coordinate mapping X to through X n, they're up here.
30:32
You add you to that. You by definition, is orthogonal.
30:41
You want is orthogonal to everything inside of W. So then you one through u one x two through X N will then form an orthogonal set.
30:45
They've all been scaled to be autho normal. So the only thing left to check is that those vectors X to three x n actually form eigenvectors for a.
30:55
So let's check that. So we just verify that their eigenvectors for em.
31:07
Let's make sure they're actually eigenvectors for a. OK, so now note, if I take this relationship here and let's just plug in what we know.
31:12
Well, we know what Ms. M is equal to p transpose a p, then we'd like to know what this thing is.
31:27
Well, that thing is just going to be p transpose times x K.
31:35
So that's what X in the B coordinates is. So then on the other side of the equation, all then have muc times p transpose x OK.
31:43
All right, well, let's think about how we could simplify this now.
31:58
The pee times treats pee transposed bit will give us an identity matrix because there are all the normal columns.
32:01
So that goes away. So then I'm left with p transpose a times x k is equal to me two times p transpose x k.
32:08
So if I wanted to get rid of that p transpose, what might I multiply both sides by p, so multiply both sides by P,
32:21
so then i get p times p transpose times eight times x k is equal to muc times p times p transpose times x k again or the normal column,
32:28
so p p transpose becomes the identity matrix. So then I'm left with a x k is equal to me two times x k.
32:40
And now what that tells us is that these vectors X to three x n are not just eigenvectors for A,
32:52
they're also they're not just eigenvectors for M, they're also eigenvectors for a.
32:59
Which sort of makes sense, because Adam was really just representing a in accordance.
33:06
Or at least hopefully makes sense. So let me move over here.
33:12
So therefore. X K is an eigen vector for.
33:28
A for each case. So thus, the collection you won X to up through x n.
33:42
You one is orthogonal to all of these because it's to the rec center elements and W, they're in the orthogonal compliment of you one.
34:03
They're all scaled to be unit vectors. So this is worth the normal.
34:12
We just checked you one x two, three x n or all eigenvectors for a.
34:15
So then this is an earth, a normal eigen basis. So this is and for the normal, I get a basis.
34:21
For A. And hence, if you haven't watched the normal eigen basis, then that means a is orthogonal, diagnosable.
34:32
But that contradicts our assumption that a was the smallest and that was not orthogonal, diagnosable.
34:54
Hence, there is no smallest end where you can not be orthogonal, diagnosable Jonathan.
35:01
What? Whether you like it or not.
35:10
I nothing. So. How do we know the excess by themselves or with the normal oh, the the links here?
35:19
Well, for one, this matrix p to transform the coordinates has what the normal column sort preserves links and it preserves dot products.
35:29
So we prove that about orthogonal multiplying by matrices with our normal columns.
35:37
So then if you have a property of vectors down here, it'll also be a property of actors up here.
35:43
So one thing we proved about that was one of our properties about matrices with all the normal
35:48
columns is that it preserves the length of the vector and it preserves the dot product.
35:53
Well. Right. So then if you have them being orthogonal down here, they'll also be orthogonal up here.
36:01
So that was. We can go through that proof afterwards again, if you want to.
36:08
Yes, Tommy. Yes, that's right.
36:13
Other questions. Yes. How do we know that it has an agent at all?
36:24
Well, we know it's a symmetric matrix, so we know it has all real eigenvalues so we can just take one of those real
36:33
eigenvalues and because an eigenvalue has to have an associated agent vector.
36:39
So then. So that's an interesting point, so eigenvalues will always have eigenvectors associated to them,
36:44
but you're then wondering how many linearly independent eigenvectors do they have associated to them?
37:04
Because you always have an infinite number of eigenvectors associated to a single eigenvalue because you can always scale one and you know,
37:09
there has to be a non-zero one for it to be an eigenvalue at all.
37:15
Because the only way that lambda can be an eigenvalue is if a X equals lambda x has some non-zero x that solves this equation.
37:19
That's the definition of lambda being an eigenvalue.
37:29
So once you know there is a real eigenvalue, then you can find an associated real eigenvectors despite computing the null space.
37:32
Other questions. So this is not a proof of the spectral theorem.
37:42
It then does get around that issue that James brings up of thinking about the dimension
37:49
of your eigen spaces because you're right that the when you have repeated eigenvalues,
37:55
you can have the geometric multiplicity being less than the algebraic multiplicity.
38:01
But this is saying that for symmetric matrices, that that won't happen. Marco, sorry.
38:06
That's a good question. So W is the orthogonal compliment of a single non-zero vector in space.
38:15
So then you want to know what, how many vectors you have orthogonal to that.
38:20
So that's given by the vanishing one equation being set equal to zero.
38:25
So you're looking at one equation, be equal to zero, you're going to have it has exactly one pivot position and the rest being free variables.
38:30
Then you know you have and minus one free variables or the rank. No, any theorem.
38:37
Tommy. Yeah, so when you have a repeated eigenvalue there, that's one place where you can have the failure of diagonal visibility.
38:43
So when you have that in your piece, you proved in the case we have distinct eigenvalues that you can with organically diagonal eyes.
38:56
And it was a nice proof there, but it didn't handle the case where we have repeated eigenvalues here.
39:03
We do handle the situation where we have repeated eigenvalues because we're not assuming anything about how
39:09
the multiplicity of the eigenvalues we just take one with and find an agent vector associated to that.
39:15
And then we just consider everything orthogonal to that.
39:21
We take like this plane orthogonal to my arm and then we just then work in that smaller thing.
39:23
And then because it's then in that space, your matrix will be acting as an RN minus one by RN minus one matrix in that plane or a smaller size.
39:30
But then you can apply your assumption to then say there it must be diagnosable.
39:39
Don't consider. They definitely could be corresponding to the same eigenvalues,
39:46
but those because it goes back to our assumption that he was the smallest size where you were not orthogonal, diagnosable.
40:02
So then when you get a matrix that's smaller,
40:10
even if there happens to be repeated eigenvalues when you have repeated eigenvalues, you can still be diagonals of all.
40:12
It just depends on whether you have enough linearly independent eigenvectors.
40:19
And our assumption then tells us, because it's a was the smallest, that means then M must be diagnosable.
40:22
Great questions. OK, so this is our last theorem for this semester.
40:31
It's sort of a nice capstone. I like that it's see you see like coordinates showing up again and you get
40:36
to see this nice diagram emphasizing a lot of the abstract ideas we've seen.
40:41
What I want to do with my last bit of time is something totally different.
40:46
So. Something that I'm very out of practice with.
40:55
Because we don't usually do this in this class. So one of the I think, nicest things about.
41:03
Harvard is that there are just so many opportunities, there are so many options for you.
41:36
And so I just wanted to make some of them known to you and what we talk about today.
41:42
And to give you an idea of where some of the ideas that we've been talking about all semester,
41:46
where they go from here since this will probably be one of my main chances to talk to the full group of you.
41:50
I wanted to do it today. So we've covered a lot of linear algebra.
42:01
We've written certainly a lot of proofs this semester. You've grown a lot as mathematicians.
42:05
So the question I think that you might be wondering about is what comes next? What do you do now?
42:10
And so I think that there are a lot of mathematical questions that are still out there coming out of this class.
42:16
So one natural question that you might be considering just coming from the course content is what about infinite dimensional vector spaces?
42:25
What happens in that setting?
42:32
And you can certainly read about some of the project ideas that people are working on to get an idea of what goes on in that direction.
42:34
And there's a lot of interesting math, I mean, even getting into philosophy and mathematical logic,
42:41
but you might also be wondering about nonlinear functions.
42:47
This is certainly the focus of Math 20 to be thinking about what happens now if we have a curved space instead of just flat some spaces,
42:50
what happens if you have some kind of a curvature? How do you then study them there?
42:58
What about working more specifically over the complex numbers instead of over the real numbers?
43:02
What about working over other sets rather than strictly speaking over the real numbers or the complex numbers?
43:07
How does that change the linear algebra that we've been doing? We have one mathematical result that we've seen before,
43:14
which was quite nice when you were thinking about the card analogy of sets that the
43:23
real numbers themselves are a strictly larger card analogy than the natural numbers.
43:26
So one fundamental question in set theory and mathematical logic and philosophy is whether there's a number in between.
43:32
Is there an infinity that's strictly smaller than the size of the real numbers and strictly larger than the size of the natural numbers?
43:39
I mean, that's actually a deep and hard question that leads to a lot of really interesting questions in the foundations of mathematics.
43:49
And then again, you can read about this idea in some of the projects that people are pursuing.
43:58
But we've seen the idea of an abstract set.
44:03
Then we put some structure on the set, whether it was through equivalence, relations and equivalence classes or whether it was through vector spaces.
44:06
But there are certainly many other ways that you could put an operation on a set and study that operation on that set with various properties,
44:14
and it could model different things, whether it's coming from engineering or physics or chemistry or whatever.
44:21
And so you could. Certainly, it doesn't have to be the scalar multiplication and vector addition operations.
44:27
You could study other types of operations as well.
44:32
So and then certainly you can think about what happens when you think about not just in a matrix of numbers,
44:37
but what if you had a three dimensional matrix so you have not an eye and AJ,
44:42
but you also have a K going out and then you can think about higher sizes for matrices and these are things called sensors.
44:46
And again, I think there are a few projects where you can read about these ideas. So what happens in what's called multi linear algebra?
44:54
So when you think about sensors, differential forms and more in those directions, so.
45:00
And applications then of all these different sort of ideas.
45:11
So I wanted to give you some highlights of what you might do aftermath twenty two.
45:16
So certainly my preference, my suggestion is 20 to be is the most natural course to take coming out of my twenty two way,
45:21
but it's certainly not the only option coming out of my twenty to a for you to consider.
45:28
And there are a lot of factors that might go into that decision,
45:32
like if you're taking Kes one twenty four people tell me it conflicts, so that might be a problem.
45:35
But there are actually a lot of spring courses that you're now mathematically prepared for.
45:42
So I wanted to highlight a few of them. So Math B is the most fundamental one that I'll point out, but it does cover the same content as math.
45:46
Twenty one, a twenty one a is still an option for anyone here that's interested.
45:54
But you can also think about dynamical systems. Math one 18. You could think about geometry.
46:00
The thing about different types of geometry, not just Euclidean geometry, but non Euclidean geometries and math.
46:07
One 30 If you're really interested in sort of connections with philosophy and logic,
46:12
there's the mathematical logic course being offered math one forty one a.
46:17
So that's a great course for you to take. If you're more interested in connections with, say, accounting and computer science,
46:22
you might think about discrete math math one fifty two or the combinatorics class math one fifty five.
46:28
If you want a more theoretical alternative to that one 10, then you could think about the probability course in the math department.
46:35
Math 154 If you just want sort of a fun class, fun math like all of these classes are fun.
46:41
If you want something that's a more relaxed class, that's fun. Math one fifty seven Math in the world.
46:50
The idea behind that class is to just kind of like, present some mathematical problems and then think about how they come up in various contexts.
46:57
So like, you might talk about game theory one week, then maybe another week you talk about applications of group theory,
47:04
maybe another week you talk about applications of different ideas within mathematics. So not all of these classes are the same workloads,
47:09
so you should certainly consider appropriately among them some of the math classes one hundred level or less work than math.
47:19
Twenty two has been. Others will be more work, so it just depends on what you're considering in a given semester.
47:27
But among the spring twenty twenty two classes, these are the ones that are at least currently on the books.
47:33
It's always possible that there might be some changes due to last minute fluctuations.
47:40
I also wanted to give you a broad overview of what the numbering system means at the one hundred level.
47:45
So in mathematics, there are three main branches the modern mathematics.
47:50
There's analysis, which is the one 10s. This is calculus. Basically, anything that has to do with limits is the math one tens.
47:54
Then there's the math one 20, which is sort of discrete math and abstract algebra.
48:03
So this is. Where you might see some linear algebra and other sort of more abstract courses, number theory, things like that.
48:07
And then the one thirties.
48:19
So I wanted to give you some ideas of what these different branches are like, so you can see what modern math is really about.
48:20
So one question you might think about in this class is what's half a derivative?
48:27
So we've thought about the derivative as a linear operator on function spaces.
48:32
So then you might say, well,
48:36
a half of a derivative then should be something a linear operator that you do twice to get the original different derivative.
48:37
So you then can study what these have derivatives do. This is called fractional calculus, and it's actually widely applied.
48:46
Most of analogy. Mathematical analysis to one 10s are used a lot in optimization in applied techniques within engineering, for instance.
48:54
You see this identity showing up a lot online in YouTube videos.
49:02
Most of them are wrong. The sum of one plus two plus three plus dot, that dot is equal to negative one over 12.
49:09
And it's sort of deliberately stated as just a provocative statement.
49:16
But of course,
49:19
like Math one 10 or math one 15 shows you how this falls out of your analysis in mathematical physics and actually has a meaningful interpretation.
49:20
You might ask the question of given a continuous function, how non differential can that function be,
49:31
for instance, like you might think about the absolute value of X,
49:39
it's a continuous function that's not differential, but the origin for how badly non differential can your function be?
49:43
Can this be just a point or a handful of points? But what can happen?
49:49
And it's then sort of a remarkable thing. Oh no. Well, this is scrawled, sorry, how did I get out of full screen?
49:54
This is what happens when you have someone that doesn't present all the time.
50:02
Yes, sir. So this is called the via straws function when via straws came up with this function in the eighteen hundreds,
50:12
this was regarded as a mathematical monster. And really,
50:22
people were quite alarmed because it posed actually found logical inconsistencies for the foundations of calculus in mathematics and caused people to
50:26
sort of revisit it in a more modern guise for analysis at the same math 112
50:34
level to then make a rigorous system where a function like this makes sense.
50:41
And this actually comes up, these kinds of functions come up a lot, and fields feels like mathematical finance,
50:45
where you might be using stochastic processes and stochastic calculus to understand things.
50:50
So there's an interesting function.
50:57
I also want to talk about this sort of fun problem from, say, math one 18, at least if I taught math one 18 where I might start the story.
50:59
Think about the following problem that you had in calc one or some fundamental problem in math is to find the zeros of a function.
51:08
OK, this is something we think about, even in math.
51:16
Twenty two a quite a lot as you just want to solve an equation that's sort of, in some sense, one of the most fundamental math problems.
51:19
So you have the equation F of X is equal to zero. And I tell you, I want you to find the zeros of this function.
51:26
Well, the most fundamental thing you would do if you have a nonlinear function is you'd say,
51:31
I'm going to use the basic idea of calculus to approximate this nonlinear function of the linear function.
51:35
So I'm going to create the equation of the tangent line. There is my linear causation up there and my function l the equation of the tangent line and
51:40
then solving L of X equals zero is hopefully giving me an approximation for f of X equals zero.
51:47
And then the idea behind, say,
51:52
Newton's method that you might have seen in calc one is that you iterate this process over and over again to keep finding the tangent lines
51:54
and keep improving and hopefully to keep improving your gas or your estimate for where the zero is to then find where it comes out to be.
52:01
So this idea of solving the equation to get this iterated map here is one way of doing that.
52:11
So that goes back, of course, to Newton. So one question that comes out of Newton's method is like.
52:18
What if your function has multiple zeros, how do we know we're getting to zero that we want?
52:27
So you could ask the question of which, where do we go when we go to the zero that we're actually interested in?
52:31
So the initial guesses, it's not that converge to one zero is called the basin of attraction of that zero.
52:37
And then the ones that go to maybe other zeros is called the base of attraction of that other zero.
52:47
So we're going to group them together based on what they eventually go to. So let's consider a simple function.
52:51
So here's a quadratic so we should be able to analyze completely what happens for this function.
52:57
So we have this graph of the function I form the equation of the tangent line,
53:03
the linear causation in green and then Newton's method tells me fine, the zero.
53:07
So I find that zero of the green function and I say, Hey, look, that's pretty close to the square of three.
53:12
Great.
53:16
Then I would find the equation of the tangent line at where the Green Zeros X Intercept is and then do the same thing again and again and again.
53:17
And I note that it converges to the square root of three. And I'm happy.
53:24
So then that means that point can is in the basement of attraction of the Square to three.
53:28
So you can probably convince yourself without too much effort that the basis of attraction is set.
53:33
B is just equal to all positive real numbers.
53:37
If I take my guess to be any positive real number, even if it's a billion it convergence of the square root of three.
53:43
If I took my initial guess to be zero, Newton's method would fail because a horizontal line doesn't intersect the axis so that it won't be in the set.
53:49
What do you think? And then if you take any negative number, it converges to a negative square to three.
54:00
So, OK, fine, we've computed the basis of attraction. It doesn't seem that complicated, but it's something.
54:06
Well, let's go to a complex plane for a moment.
54:14
So now suppose we take a function from sea to sea, so the focus of something you might study in that one 13 a complex analysis class.
54:17
So a simple function would be something of the form F of Z is equal to Z squared minus three now again, where Z is a complex number.
54:25
So the same polynomial for before, but now it's complex instead of real.
54:31
And then I'm going to take Newton's method as before.
54:36
I mean, derivatives for polynomials work the same way for complex numbers, so I can apply the same procedure and see what happens.
54:39
So here are the basics of attractions in the complex plane.
54:48
So this purple region so great here. This will be the real axis of thought here and a little dot here.
54:53
Those correspond to the real zeros of this function.
55:00
And every purple point, even if I guess way down here in the imaginary plane, Newton's method will then converge to the actual real value.
55:03
If I took any point over here, it will then converge to negative square root of three.
55:14
OK. So again, it's not wildly different. It seems like you've just extended off the real axis into the real plane, so not wildly different.
55:19
So let's maybe consider a slightly more complicated example now.
55:29
Let's try Z cubed minus three. So again, not so different.
55:33
Here are the basins of attraction of the cubed minus three. So again, now we'll have three zeros in the complex plane.
55:40
One will be along the real axis and the other two will have imaginary components.
55:47
So here are the zeros for the basics of attraction.
55:55
So what this is telling you is right over here, you can see that line going through the origin is the real axis.
56:00
That's where one of the real zero, the where the real zero is the keyboard of three along the real axis.
56:07
So every purple gas will converge under Newton's method to that zero.
56:16
So even if I'm way down here in this purple region.
56:21
My my four or five year old now tells me I'm not very good with colors, I think that's purple.
56:26
I don't know if you agree with me, but this region, which I'm calling purple, will then converge by Newton's method up to there.
56:32
Any warmed point will convert to the zero over here.
56:40
Any green gas will convert to the zero up there.
56:44
So what's really interesting is you get this really subtle behavior around these certain regions where,
56:47
like small perturbations can result in wildly different long term behavior.
56:54
So you get this interesting fractal shapes coming out, and then you can even think about how this story evolves for even more complicated functions.
56:59
This is just the behavior coming from thinking about a cubic function,
57:10
and you'll notice that it has sort of these three tendrils going off describing this sort of behavior of this function,
57:14
where it's like these regions where it's more complicated.
57:22
What do you think would happen if I took a quadratic function or sorry, a cathartic function or a Quantic function?
57:24
What do you think might happen? What's your guess? You would have a guess what might happen.
57:31
Matthew? Pads going off.
57:40
That seems like a good guess, right? It seems like that might be what happens.
57:48
And you can what's kind of fun here is you can even experiment by just like plotting
57:52
some of these fractal shapes to see what does happen for different regions.
57:55
So this is a field called complex dynamics. And I mean, this is one of the topics that comes up.
58:01
There's also a field called real dynamics where you can talk about chaos theory and all of those sorts of things.
58:06
These do come up in math one 18, and this actually comes up in a lot of scenarios where a lot of the physical models you might create for
58:11
various things like neurons firing in the brain or your heart beating come from dynamical systems models.
58:18
So you might want to know like is your model chaotic? Is your model predictable?
58:24
How can you understand it? So it's actually applied as well.
58:28
So the math 120s some questions to maybe get you interested in the math one 20 is that or considered here?
58:33
You might think about questions like Can you generalize the quadratic formula to higher degree polynomials,
58:40
or can you prove that it can't be generalized? So can you complete the cube?
58:45
Can you complete the Hypercube? Things like that. I might like completing the square.
58:49
How can you mathematically encode and study cemetery? So what exactly does that mean?
58:55
You can even think about some of the group projects are considering,
59:00
like encoding the cemetery properties of chemical molecules and using group theory to study that cemetery.
59:03
You can think of about questions and number theory. Can every positive energy be expressed as the sum of four squares?
59:12
Can it be some expressed as the sum of three squares of two squares?
59:17
Can every integer greater than to be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers?
59:22
So there are quite a lot of, I think, interesting questions that are not super hard to state that come up in these courses in the one thirties.
59:27
This is geometry and topology and perhaps most relevant to physics and economics.
59:36
The first question, which will be a question and the fundamental question of math 20 to be, is how do we generalize calculus to higher dimensions?
59:43
The difference between math 20 to be in math twenty one A will be the language that you use to answer that question,
59:50
whether you use linear algebra in answering that question or not.
59:56
In Math 20 to be, we will use linear algebra to fundamentally answer that.
1:00:00
And in math twenty one you want. So you might think about what our higher dimensional analogs of surfaces this is what are called manifolds.
1:00:05
You can think about how do you understand the shape of space? How do you detect her curvature?
1:00:14
How do you stack holes in space? How do you stack flatness?
1:00:18
How do you detect connectedness like if you have some point cloud in space, some very large data set?
1:00:20
Can you detect if it's actually a very large dataset that contains some whole within it?
1:00:26
How would you algebraically detect that hole? How would you if you knew that it all sort of was on the surface of a donut?
1:00:30
I mean, that's interesting to know whether that structure exists in a large dataset.
1:00:36
But if it's like a 10 million dimensional dataset, I mean, how are you supposed to just see it?
1:00:40
You can't just see it. You have to have tools for detecting it, for understanding it and measuring it.
1:00:46
How can we generalize continuity to more general spaces, how do we can what happens if we measure distance in different ways?
1:00:53
These are called metric spaces. It's again kind of blends with the math one terms as well.
1:00:58
I also thought that maybe some of you might want some mathematical reading over the break. You might already have plenty of mathematical reading.
1:01:05
But if you are thinking about these different directions, especially if you just like an overview on what math is,
1:01:13
one relatively old book that I quite like, it's called the Nature and Growth of Modern Mathematics by Edna Kramer.
1:01:19
I read it when I was a kid and. You certainly I mean, there are topics in there that even now,
1:01:26
you won't necessarily understand fully, I mean, I certainly didn't when I read it the first time.
1:01:35
But it's very good to give you kind of an idea of where these big ideas were coming from.
1:01:39
I mean, it goes back to the Babylonians and then kind of goes forward to thinking about like how differential geometry shows up in relativity.
1:01:43
And it really does give you a nice story of how these ideas evolved.
1:01:50
If you're thinking about more of like a book on like, how would you improve your proof writing?
1:01:55
My favorite reference is this book Mathematical Thinking by D'Angelo and West, which is built around puzzles.
1:02:01
And so it's quite a lot of fun. You can just kind of like, read some puzzles and think about how you might solve them.
1:02:07
And it's a great way to get a bit more experience writing proofs if you're thinking that you want to get ready for a course like math one 12.
1:02:13
There are some nice analysis books that you might consider if you're thinking about the one twenties.
1:02:22
There are some nice abstract algebra books that you could read. Um, if you're more interested in the one thirties,
1:02:28
there's some geometry and topology books that you might enjoy if you're more interested in
1:02:35
connections with number theory accommodates works like Concrete Mathematics by Donald Knuth.
1:02:39
Knuth was the guy who created tech, among other things.
1:02:44
He's a Stanford computer science professor,
1:02:48
and concrete mathematics was the the course that he taught at Stanford for many years on and math for computer science.
1:02:50
And so it's filled with really great questions and great fun problems to solve.
1:02:58
I also wanted to think about some resources for you going forward.
1:03:06
So I think one great resource you have is all the 22A projects that I'm going to post to the canvas page in a week or so we can have.
1:03:09
And I think it'll be a great place to kind of get an idea of where some of the ideas in this course,
1:03:19
where they go and read them and think about those and kind of a nice light way.
1:03:24
They're also two nice places where we can find free math books. Springer Link is Harvard students.
1:03:29
You get access to all the Springer books.
1:03:34
These are the yellow books and they it's an enormous library of really high quality math books for you that are normally relatively expensive,
1:03:36
but as Harvard students, you get them for free.
1:03:45
They're also an initiative towards open Open-Source textbooks by the American Institute of Mathematics,
1:03:47
and so you can find a bunch of nice textbooks there that you might read.
1:03:53
I think one thing that I've been most proud of with this course is the wonderful community that all of you have created.
1:03:57
So you're certainly your classmates are a great resource for you to consider going forward.
1:04:02
A few years ago, some grad students and I created what's called the directed reading program in mathematics.
1:04:08
And I think this is also a really nice place for getting some more experience with mathematics and a very sort of relaxed and laid back way.
1:04:16
The idea is that you're paired with a graduate student for a semester long reading project on a mutually chosen topic.
1:04:24
And so you find a topic that you're both interested in. The department buys a book for you.
1:04:31
We pay for you to go out to coffee with the grad student,
1:04:36
and you can talk about what it's like to be a grad student in math and what that pathway is like,
1:04:38
and also just get some advice and learning that topic. So it can be a nice way if you want to learn something, but you're like,
1:04:44
I can't for the full math class in my schedule this semester or second full math class in my schedule four of us for a semester.
1:04:51
But it can be a really, I think, a nice, rewarding experience to have, like more direct one on one mentoring.
1:04:59
And so there's you're welcome to apply for that any semester here at Harvard.
1:05:07
The projects are just completely chosen by you and the grad student at whatever level you want it to be at.
1:05:13
I mean, you might want to put a ton into it. You might only want to put like an hour a week into it.
1:05:19
So it's not very flexible. I also certainly want to point out that I'm a resource for all of you going forward.
1:05:22
I mean, forever. You're always welcome to email me. I'm always very happy to chat about math.
1:05:30
And one of my favorite things in the world to do is to talk to students about math and also to hear about what you're doing,
1:05:36
where you're going from here or what you're doing next. I mean, I think it's nice when I get to stay in contact with everybody.
1:05:43
So keep that in mind that you should never feel nervous or reluctant to email me to reach out.
1:05:51
I think it's exciting to hear what people are up to, what they're doing.
1:05:57
So definitely keep that in mind.
1:06:01
One of the things that I've been most excited about this semester was working with all of you and getting to know all of you this semester.
1:06:04
It's been really a lot of fun. So please come and see me over the next week and a half of a reading period.
1:06:13
Hopefully, I'll see a lot of you in math 20 to be that I'll be back and you'll all be back.
1:06:20
That's the ideal. But even if that's not the case,
1:06:25
you're always welcome to come and talk to me in January about what math class to take or what you're interested in doing.
1:06:29
But it's been a blast. And thanks very much for all your hard work this semester.
1:06:34
Thank you for your. Thanks.
1:07:01
I even ended with enough time to pay off my time debt, so I didn't I didn't go overtime in the last day.
1:07:09
And thanks for the front row for the kind of message here. Yes, yes.
